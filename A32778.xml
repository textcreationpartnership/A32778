            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Publiſher to the READER.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Doubt not but the following Diſcourſes carry ſo much evidence of Truth and Holineſs, as will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently commend them to the Hearts and Conſciences of the upright, as proceeding from one, who believed, and therefore ſpake; delivered what he received, as a Scribe inſtructed unto the Kingdom of Heaven, the Fear of the Lord being evidently his treaſure, wherein he walked all the day long, and by which he was enabled to bear thoſe hard things, which a conſtant Spirit, in keeping the Commandments of God and Faith of Jeſus, holding faſt the Word and Works of God, drew upon him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> bringing him into fellowſhip with tryals and ſufferings, upon the Wayes, Truths, Intereſt, and People of the Lord in this Generation.</p>
            <p>It may highly concern the living, to lay to heart the removal of Prophets and holy Ones, true mourners, that ſought to ſtand in the Gap, to turn away wrath, that it might not come to the utmost.</p>
            <p>I am ſure it hath a ſad aſpect, when even a Profeſſing (but too much complying) People, ſtand as on the other ſide, or at a diſtance from thoſe who earneſtly contend for the Faith, holding faſt what they have received, and are far from right laying to heart, <hi>That through the hatred of the world, righteous men periſh, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful men are taken away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I doubt not, but there remains a remnant, whoſe minds by ſuch providences are deeply impreſſed, well-nigh to over-whelming, further than help is given, and the hand ſtretched forth, to lead to the Rock that is
<pb facs="tcp:40849:3"/> higher than we, when in all parts and corners the beauty and glory is cutting off as a fading-flower; and how hard is it to ſpeak and do as becometh, under ſuch aſtoniſhing ſtroaks, and with him, <hi>Ezek. 24.18.</hi> to hold on, doing as the Lord Commands, I am perſwaded that ſigh often goes up, <hi>Ezek. 11.13.</hi> with <hi>Amos 7.5. O Lord, ceaſe I beſeech thee, by whom ſhall</hi> Jacob <hi>ariſe, for he is ſmall.</hi> The reviving and deſired iſſues of that work fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling under great diſtruſts, even with thoſe that are the Friends thereof, when (if I may allude to it, <hi>Luke 24.19,</hi> &amp;c) thoſe, who are as Prophets, mighty in deed and word before God and all the People, Inſtruments poliſhed to carry it on to an expected end, are cut off and laying aſide daily, ſo hard is it for us to underſtand that <hi>thus it ought to be,</hi> that ſo the excellency of the power, may be acknowledged to be of God and not of men, that all may ſee <hi>his Work is perfect, his Word is tryed,</hi> with whom is no reſtraint, for he ſendeth by whom he will, the reſidue of the Spirit being with him, who will in due time raiſe up and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Inſtruments for every ſervice; and if at this time men think that by cutting off, and wearing out Saints and faithful Ones, their neſt is ſet on high, they ſhall be delivered from the power of evil, none remaining to cry out of their violence and ſpoyl, to detect the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs of their wayes and doings, the very <hi>ſtone ſhall cry out of the Wall, and the beam out of the Timber ſhall witneſs againſt them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I humbly pray, and wiſh that the caſt-out, ſcattered, peeled people, in whoſe heart is the Fear of the Lord, under all amuſing diſpenſations, may yet increaſe in the Faith that ſtands in the Power of God, and is of the operation of his Spirit, in the exerciſe thereof, which judgeth not after appearances, they may underſtand all
<pb facs="tcp:40849:3"/> theſe deaths, paſſing over perſons and things, but need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and preparatory for the Glory that is to follow, when their filth and defilements by the Spirit of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and by the Spirit of Burning ſhall be put away; the ſlow progreſs of which work, with the diſcovery made of ſo great a defection from profeſſed Light and Principles, ought greatly to be laid to heart, how many by reaſon thereof, turn from the Truth, and are confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Athieſm, even by the deceitful working of thoſe, who in the failure of outward advantages, and expoſal to neceſſities, bonds, and death, ſet themſelves at ſuch a diſtance from the works of God, our eyes have ſeen (the begining of fulfilling Propheſies, Threatnings, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to the last dayes) as if either there was no Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or Righteouſneſs in them, or that they were unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the inward Life and Spirit of them, ſo deeply hath corruption &amp; the ſpirit of the world mingled it ſelf, with thoſe, who not long ſince, in greateſt ſeeming Light and Zeal, profeſſed, to ſeek after a better ſtate of things, <hi>Even looking for, and haſtning to the new Heavens, and new Earth, wherein dwells Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> but the Works of God being forgotten, no wonder his Word is ſo little believed, or his counſel waited for.</p>
            <p>It was a worthy Expoſtulation, but a few years ſince, (before ſome then in the exerciſe of Authority) of one, who I fear hath out-lived the force of it, which though large, hoping it may be of uſe, I take leave here to tranſcribe; <q>If you will be able to <hi>ſteer your Courſe a-right,</hi> if you would take <hi>one ſtreight ſtep,</hi> have in a readineſs an acquaintance with the work of God, what it is that he aims at, by which you may be guided in all your undertakings. Suppoſe now a <hi>man</hi> or <hi>men</hi> ſhould come and ask of you, What God hath done in theſe Nations? What he hath wrought and effected?
<pb facs="tcp:40849:4"/> What is brought forth? Have you an anſwer in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs? Certainly God hath done ſo much, as that he expects you ſhould be able to give an account of it; take heed that every one of you be not ready to ſpeak the diſquietments of your own Spirits, and ſo caſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt on <hi>the Work of God;</hi> ſomething elſe is required of you, I have ſometimes in darkneſs and under temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations my ſelf, begun to think, that what hath been, is the thing that is, and there is no new thing under the Sun; as it hath been among the Heathen of old, ſo it hath been amongst us; or as it was with <hi>Iſrael, 1 King. 16.21, 22. Then were the people of</hi> Iſrael <hi>divided into two parts, half of the people followed</hi> Tibni, <hi>the ſon of</hi> Ginath, <hi>to make him King; and half followed</hi> Omri: <hi>but the people that followed</hi> Omri, <hi>prevailed againſt the people that followed</hi> Tibni, <hi>the ſon of</hi> Ginath; <hi>ſo</hi> Tibni <hi>died, and</hi> Omri <hi>reigned.</hi> That a <hi>common thing</hi> and frequent in the World, had befaln us, wherein God had no hand, but that of common Providence, in daſhing one ſort of men againſt another; ſo <hi>fooliſh</hi> have I been, and as a Beaſt, <hi>ſo ready to condemn the Generation of the Righteous;</hi> ſo <hi>unbelieving,</hi> and ready to caſt away the Faith and Prayer of ten thouſand Saints, one of whoſe ſighs ſhall not be loſt; but <hi>ſuch fearful effects</hi> ſometimes, trouble, diſquietment, diſappointment, and carnal fear will produce. But certain it is, none of the many cryes of the people of God ſhall be loſt, nor their Faith diſappointed; God hath a peculiar deſign in hand, and we are to find it out, that we may be able to anſwer them that make enquiries. If you lay not this foundation of your <hi>procedures,</hi> I ſhall not wonder, if you err in your wayes; it is your <hi>Pole-Star,</hi> and will be ſo, by which your whole courſe is to be ſteered; your

            </p>
            <p>What then may we now expect, but after a little further fluctuating upon the deep, to ſuffer ſhipwrack upon ſome Shelves or Rocks, ſeeing we have ceaſed our ſteerage by this <hi>Pole-Star?</hi> what may we expect, but ſlaughter and extirpation, ſince that <hi>Mighty Shield</hi> is <hi>vilely caſt away, as though it had not been anointed with Oyl?</hi> conſidering alſo, that if <hi>the hand of violence be returned,</hi> its confederated with, under the ſacred ties of Oaths &amp; Covenants, even whilst it manifeſtly oppoſes Godlineſs, and bends the edge of all its power againſt ſuch as love the Lord Jeſus in ſincerity; I am ſure it calls for deep lamentation, that a People, who had the Name of the Lord upon them, are left to that wonderful and horrible thing; <hi>(Jer. 5. laſt.) Prophets propheſying falſely, and Princes bearing rule by their means, and both Prophets and People (through a little preſent fleſhly eaſe and proſperity, waxing fat and ſhining) love to have it ſo;</hi> the holy Spirit, then aſſures, the end will be bitter, and that enquiry, What will ye do, in the end thereof? though ſlightly paſſed over now, will have its reſolve, by their cry to the Mountains and Rocks, to fall on, and hide them from the face of him that ſitteth on the Throne, when in the faileur of juſtice on Earth, he will cauſe judgement to be heard from Heaven, <hi>When he ariſeth,</hi> as certainly he will, <hi>to judge the Cauſe of the Fatherleſs and Needy, and to ſave all the meek of the Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I may not further thus proceed, leſt I exceed
<pb facs="tcp:40849:5"/> bounds, nor is it needful that more be ſaid of the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,</hi> only I am perſwaded it greatly furthered him in the ſearch after, &amp; knowledge of divine mysteries, that he never was entangled, and diſadvantaged by Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical Education, which hath been over-fruitful, in furniſhing perſons (as worthy Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occaſion in his Letters expreſſes it) with <hi>ill waſhen and foul diſtinctions to ſhift Chriſt,</hi> this age hath over-plentiful teſtimony thereof; this Servant of the Lord, as by the account left of himſelf, in the laſt two Pages of this Book, was by his believing Parents, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe nurtured, who waiting at the foot of Christ, keeping his precepts diligently, became wiſer than his Teachers, giving occaſion to many to renew that ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Whence hath this man letters?</hi> for he was <hi>elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and mighty in the Scriptures;</hi> adding much to ſuch as converſed with him, whether by word or Epiſtle.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:40849:10"/> ſuſtained things inſufferable in the eye of ſence and reaſon; nothing therefore low or mean is attributed in this place, nor ſhould our aims or expectation be flat and indifferent in the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation thereof.</p>
                  <p>It's moſt true, this Hiſtory of the famous acts of Beleevers, is drawn out of the Old Teſtament, and calculated (as I may ſo expreſs it) to that meridian, <hi>Theſe all died in faith, obtaining a good report, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived not the Promiſe,</hi> verſ. 13. &amp; 39. yet ſerveth not only indifferently for the Goſpel-dayes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we are, but indeed commends it ſelf the more tranſcendently to us, by how much God hath provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſome better things for us; having opened more fully the obiect of believing <hi>the Lord Jeſus in the Goſpel,</hi> and poured out more plentifully the holy Spirit of <hi>Promiſe,</hi> than it was ordinarily in thoſe dayes: which Conſideration may ſerve to afford both mighty Aid and Argument to Believers now, to encourage Chriſtians to truſt upon the Lord, to do for them more than they can ask or think, according to the power which worketh in them, in their faithful following him.</p>
                  <p>Not to ſtand upon the opening particularly of theſe words, nor on the exact time when they were fulfilled; very likely this, and ſome other here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout had reference to the cruel ſufferings in the times of the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> which the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> to whom this Epiſtle was written, had reaſon to have a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular knowledge of, although the Hiſtory to us be <hi>Apocrypha;</hi> it may ſuffice us, that the Spirit of the Lord hath here infallibly determined, ſuch things were done, and that the Conqueſt was truly attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butable to this believing, as it dealt with, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:40849:10"/> drew vertue from the power of God. So that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out more a-do, in the words are <hi>Four</hi> things ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveable;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Here is the Noble and Glorious Principle in which all theſe rare exploits are wrought; on the commendation of which, the whole Chapter inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. <hi>By Faith</hi> they did it; whether in all the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject mentioned, it was a Faith that was ſaving, will not be here diſputed; this is plain, it was ſuch Faith at leaſt, as falls within the <hi>Word of God,</hi> and builds upon the Authority thereof, in the buſineſs they were concerned in; upon which foundation they went through, and under-went what was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, in following God in their generations.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We have here the ſubject, or ſeat of action, upon which this great Experiment is tryed; and that is a tortured, butchered, maſſacred, harmleſs, weak Believer; <hi>Others were Tortured,</hi> a particular Inventory whereof made and taken in the verſes following, 36, 37, 38. ſuch cruel uſages as were beneath humanity to inflict, and above humanity to ſuſtain, were exerciſed on, and invincibly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured by theſe poor ſouls, under the aid and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of that Faith of theirs.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Here is the magnanimity and excellency of ſpirit deſcribed, unto which their faith raiſed them, putting its ſelf in the noble denyal &amp; repulſe given to the tender of deliverance, upon any unworthy terms; <hi>They Accepted not Deliverance,</hi> though their Perſecuters came with torments in one hand, and tenders in the other, in as much as both were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt Artifices and Engines to accompliſh the ſame deſign: as they ſlighted the threatnings of the one, ſo they ſcorned the allurements of the other. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40849:11"/> in it ſelf, and as it may be conſidered, is a mercy; and the acceptance of it is a duty; and conſequently the refuſal of it would have been their evil. But if Deliverance cannot be had but upon terms diſhonorable to the Lord; if deliverance be a ſnare, then to accept of ſuch deliverance is a ſin, at leaſt a great blemiſh to beleeving; of which more hereafter.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We have the powerful Motive, and bleſſed Proſpect that Faith took in view, from whence ſtrength was gathered to bear the tortures, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear the deliverance, and that was, <hi>The obtaining a better Reſurrection;</hi> they had their eye and heart ſet upon a way of deliverance, for which they would be beholding to the Lord only, and this is called, <hi>A better Reſurrection;</hi> that is, not only better than their tortures, but better alſo than any deliverance that could be offer'd to them: this fixed expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Faith carried them above any baſe or unworthy cringings to the ſons of violence.</p>
                  <p>If you conſider the words in their Connexion and dependancy on the former part of the verſe, you have this obſervable; Women received their dead (Children) returned to life again; this was verified, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 17.23. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 4.36. Others (<hi>viz.</hi> other Women) were tortured (i. e) had their living children tortured, not accepting deliverance for them; this is ſtoried 2 <hi>Maccab.</hi> 6. If we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider Women as the ſubjects of this ſtrong Faith, who are ſtiled, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.7. the weaker veſſels; Widows (perhaps) and deſolate, yet truſting in God, hardly any faith out-went theirs: <hi>Oh Woman, Great is thy Faith:</hi> we might by the way gather this Obſervation:</p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:40849:11"/>
                  <p>☞ <hi>That the weaker veſſels may be capable of exerciſing the ſtrongeſt Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Out of weakneſs they were made ſtrong: <hi>when I am weak, then I am ſtrong;</hi> this treaſure (as well as the diſcoveries of the Goſpel) is put into earthen-veſſels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us; that as the ſtrength of Fleſh may not glory in his preſence, ſo neither may the weakneſs of a poor Saint occaſion him to ſink or diſpond, but he that glorieth may glory on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Lord. — But I ſhall not ſtand here, but proceed to draw forth, and make a brief improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſome of the Obſervations that lie moſt plain in the words themſelves: one of which is plainly thus;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. That the moſt cruel tortures that have been invented by the vileſt ſons of men, have (by divine permiſſion) been vented upon the choiceſt ſons of God. They <hi>of whom,</hi> in Gods accompt, <hi>the world was not worthy,</hi> the beſt of earth was not good enough for them, <hi>verſ.</hi> 38. in mans accompt, the worſt of earth was not bad enough: As <hi>they are made the filth of the world, and off-ſcouring of all things,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.13. ſo no inſtruments of cruelty can be enough vile or forcible in their thoughts to rid and deliver it of them. The luſt and rage in all genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions hath been fruitful in inventions of this kind, <hi>they were ſtoned, they were ſawn aſunder, &amp;c.</hi> the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable variety of particulars are reducible to this general, <hi>They where Tortured.</hi> I ſhall only at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to purſue this Point to an iſſue, by ſpeaking briefly to theſe two enquiries, 1. What is meant by theſe <hi>Tortures.</hi> 2. Whence hath it ſprung that they (ſuch an harmleſs People as they) have had
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40849:12"/> this for theit <hi>lot,</hi> or <hi>why</hi> have they been <hi>tortured</hi> thus?</p>
                  <p>As for the former thus, The word here rendered <hi>torture,</hi> is obſerved no where elſe to be uſed in the New-Teſtament, and in ſtrictneſs of ſpeech ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth, to be uſed and dealt withal, as men do with a Drum, <hi>viz.</hi>

                     </gap>: which figurative expreſſion directs us for its mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, either to the <hi>manner</hi> or <hi>end</hi> of mens cruel deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them. If the former be lookt on as inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, then the reſemblance is taken from the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of their <hi>torments,</hi> anſwering either to the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſtretching out, or diſtending the head of the Drum, which (you know) by cords and other means is braced at times to the utmoſt extremity. Thus have the precious limbs and members, not only of our Lord himſelf, but of his deareſt children, been violently diſtorted, till part hath been plucked from part on Racks or other Engins, and that complaint litterally verified, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.14. <hi>I am poured out like water, all my bones are out of joynt.</hi> — Or elſe it an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to the beating of a drum, which is performed with both hands, with multiplicity of ſtroaks not to be numbred; and then it referreth to thoſe cruel beatings, ſtripes, and blows that have been beyond meaſure laid upon their backs, ſuch as of which the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Some had tryal of cruel mockings and ſcourgings. Paul</hi> records the number and meaſure of his beatings by the <hi>Jews,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.24. as though they would keep ſtroke as on a Drum: ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended order is ſometimes ſpoken of by ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volters as are profound to make ſlaughter, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 5.2. but at other times they were ſtripes without mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, <hi>verſ.</hi> 23, 25. beating with rods, beating with
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40849:12"/> ſtones; hence he <hi>was in deaths oft,</hi> in this path muſt we expect to follow our Lord, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.4, 5. <hi>in ſtripes in impriſonment, &amp;c.</hi> This ſets forth the liberal and unlimitted cruelty in point of act that wicked men have ſtill abounded in.</p>
                  <p>Or otherwiſe, the metaphor directs us to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the <hi>end</hi> and <hi>deſign</hi> of the <hi>Perſecutors</hi> in the extention of their cruelty, and this alſo under this ſimilitude, may refer one of theſe two wayes: Firſt, to ſet out the <hi>deſign</hi> of the <hi>Tormentors</hi> (as is the Souldiers in beating their Drum) thereby to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimate, encourage, and hearten thoſe that are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged with themſelves; that look as that warlike-ſound is intended to quicken, chear-up, and delight the ſpirits of ſuch Warriors; ſo are the extorted groans and cryes of the Lords poor ſufferers, level<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the heightning the pride, ſcorn, and deriſion of a bloudy generation.

The more ſhamefully the Apoſtles were intreated, they were the more bold in their God, to Preach the Goſpel of their God with much contention, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.2.

                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:40849:13"/>
                  <p>Theſe Tortures upon the harmleſs Lambs of Chriſt, have been exerciſed in ſeveral Ages of the world with much variety, according to the fruitful womb of luſt of the ſons of violence, who from ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration to generation derive and ſuck the ſpirit of Perſecution from him that was of the wicked-one, and ſlew his Brother; and hath more or leſs, exerted its ſelf according to the opportunities they have had for ſo doing, which have been frequently either more relaxed, or reſtrained, as hath ſeemed beſt to infinite Wiſdom to bring about his ends and deſigns of Glory in the earth. But though theſe great and ſore tryals are the common lot of Saints in all ages, yet there are ſome eminent and peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar Periods, ſome remarkable points of time, which the Scripture doth refer unto, that may be called in an eſpecial manner <hi>the times of ſuch torment,</hi> with which we have need be well acquainted, and our concernment reſpecting them.</p>
                  <p>The Firſt time that I note ſuch tortures were in date and faſhion (as I may expreſs it) is that (as I underſtand) the Text points at, namely, toward the latter end of the <hi>Grecian Monarchy;</hi> not but that divers fair Sons and Daughters of God, had their ſhare deeply in Sufferings before, ſundry times. But now it grew to be the common expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all thoſe that would hold up any Profeſſion of the true <hi>God,</hi> a time was come over them, which carried this in the very front of it; it was a tortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring time, eſpecially under <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> of whom we have ſuch an exact deſcription, under the notion of a little Horn, the very point and venom of which, is levelled againſt the people of the Saints of the moſt High; reade him pourtrayed, <hi>Dan.</hi> 8,

This dreadful oppoſition and perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was made to the <hi>Name of God</hi> againſt ſuch as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the Profeſſion of it, according to the Laws and Ordinances given by the hand of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is a Second Period, or ſpecial point of time wherein the tortures of the Lords people are remarked, and that is under the reign and rage of the Dragon, exerciſing his power in the Roman Monarchy conſidered as Pagan; this is deſcribed by that fourth Beaſt, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.7, 8. dreadful and terrible, and <hi>verſ.</hi> 19, 20. exceeding dreadful; this princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally reſpects thoſe incredible tortures that were inflicted throughout the whole Roman Territories (which were wide and large) upon any who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed the <hi>Name of Chriſt,</hi> eſpecially in the Reigns of thoſe <hi>Ten bloody Emperors,</hi> known commonly by the name of the <hi>Ten Perſecutions:</hi> As the former was againſt profeſſion of the <hi>Name of God</hi> under the Old-Teſtament; ſo this was againſt the profeſſion of the <hi>Name of Chriſt</hi> under the New.</p>
                  <p>A Third time to which, by way of eminency, the Tortures of the Lords people is appropriated, is the time of the Reign, and eſpecially towards the Ruine of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> deſcribed in <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. in its di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Powers under the firſt and ſecond Beaſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning ſhort upon the Empires profeſſing the <hi>Name of Chriſt,</hi> &amp; carrying threatnings and ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters againſt the true Witneſſes of the Spirit &amp; Life of Chriſt, though pretending to the Name of him; and this not only during the 1260 dayes or years aſſigned him, but principally at the end thereof, when for a ſhort ſpace Power muſt be given him to ſlay thoſe Witneſſes with ſuch a ſlaughter, as car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth

My apprehenſion and expectation hereupon, is, that we are near upon the borders of (if we have not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready made ſome entrance on) an hour of ſore tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation, which will try all them that (profeſſing an intereſt in heaven) do dwell upon earth; in which it will be found of great moment that we ſtand girt about with the whole Armour of Righteouſneſs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the right hand, &amp; on the left, eſpecially holding faſt this ſhield of Faith, whereby, though in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges paſt ſome were tortured, yet they were more then Conquerors, they over-come by the blood of the Lamb, &amp;c. Our Second Enquiry in opening the Obſervation, was, Whence comes it to paſs, that ſuch a people as the Lords people are (at leaſt wiſe ought to be) are nevertheleſs expoſed to ſuch torments, they who are the bleſſing to the whole Creation, ſimple concerning evil, willing to live honeſtly, following peace with all men, as much as it is poſſible, ſent forth as ſheep in the midſt of wolves, blameleſs and harmleſs as the ſons of God without rebuke, profeſſing and ſtriving to anſwer this principle, yet are hated, caſt out, perſecuted as the filth of the World, the troublers of <hi>Iſrael,</hi>

                  <p>I proceed to take ſome other Obſervations from the words, <hi>Others were tortured;</hi> Some were tryed otherwayes, others this way; ſome were tortured, not all; all are exerciſed ſome way or other, every man's work muſt be tryed. <hi>Whoſoever will live godly in Chriſt Jeſus, must ſuffer perſecution,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.12. <hi>He chaſteneth every ſon whom he receiveth,</hi> Heb. 12.6. <hi>Whomſoever he loves, he rebukes and chaſteneth,</hi> Rev. 3.19.

This is a plain caſe and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to frequent experience.

                  <p>For the former: We now reſpect tortures as they are more immediately under the diſpoſal and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of the Lord, appointing more or leſs in point or meaſure, to more or fewer ſubjects as it pleaſeth him; they being ſuch bitter things as afore is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, it is enquired, <hi>Why the Father appoints it to any of his Children?</hi> To this is anſwered,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Negatively, not from any love God hath to the Torments, or from any lack or abatement of love to his Children, he doth not take pleaſure to ſee his precious believing People lie ſcattered up and down (as they are deſcribed <hi>Pſal.</hi> 141.7. &amp; 79.2, 3. <hi>Lam.</hi> 4.1, 2.) as ſo many marks and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents of the cruelty and butchery of the ſons of men: no, ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.15. <hi>Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the ſight of the Lord is the death of his Saints;</hi> he eſteems them precious in their lives, and puts a value on them in their death. It goes (as we may ſpeak with reverence) near the heart of the Lord to ſee his Jewels thus dealt withal; <hi>In all their Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons he is afflicted, and the Angel of his Preſence is with them,</hi> Iſa. 63.9. <hi>He that toucheth them, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the apple of his eye,</hi> Zech. 2.8. <hi>He doth not afflict willingly, or grieve the children of men,</hi> Lam. 3.33. much leſs the Children of God, but rather <hi>like as a father pitieth his children, ſo the Lord pittieth them that fear him; for he knoweth our frame, and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that we are but duſt,</hi> Pſal. 103.13, 14. nay, he hath teſtified the greateſt diſpleaſure againſt ſuch as have bin executioners of his rebukes, when they have not performed them with pity, <hi>Zech.</hi> 1.15. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 47.6. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.26, 27.

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. But poſitively and in general thus. Though the Lord doth not aſſign theſe Tortures, theſe fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Tryals to his Children, for want of love to his, or from any delight he hath in ſuch Tortures con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in themſelves; Yet many times the Lord hath higher and better ends to promote then their deliverance; ends that have more of good in them than theſe Tortures can poſſibly have of evil; and when it is ſo, theſe diſpenſations are not only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable, but are to be juſtified, <hi>Good is the Word of the Lord.</hi> As namely,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Sometimes in giving his darlings thus to the power of the Dog, he deſigns to bring to light the worth and excellency of ſome <hi>Truths</hi> of his, which otherwayes would be much obſcured, if not quite excluded from among the children of men; namely, ſuch Truths, in the vindication of which his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are called and brought forth thus to ſuffer, being wrought to a contentedneſs, rather to endure torments than to let them go. When a ſoul or peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple having obtained help from God, continue wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſing to ſuch Truths whatever it coſts them; There is reflected this honour upon Truth, as was ſaid of it of old, <hi>Great is Truth, and it ſhall prevail;</hi> whereas if it ſhould be as it is with the generality of Profeſſors at this day, when a Truth comes to be ſpoken for, there is ſuch a ſhrinking, twiſting, ſhifting to evade the dint of the Tryal, how would the World have too juſt cauſe to ſay, What is there in your beloved Truth, more than in our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:40849:20"/> Error? What is your Profeſſion more than ours? your Religion more than ours? If there were any excellent thing in it, you would do and ſuffer ſomewhat excellent and extraordinary for it, to take off this ſtumbling block and occaſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore from them who ſeek or deſire occaſion; the Lord is pleaſed to ſteel a people to this height, <hi>We can do nothing againſt the truth, but for the truth,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.8. And then to ſhew a proof of Truth in them, and the power and goodneſs thereof, he puts them on a tryal proportioned to this deſign; he hath ſome truth of the Goſpel to ſhew in <hi>Paul,</hi> and then muſt <hi>he be troubled on every ſide,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.8, 9, 10. <hi>chap.</hi> 6.4, 10, 11. <hi>chap.</hi> 11.23. to 29. If the truth of Chriſt be in him, no man ſhall ſtop him of his boaſting, none of theſe things move him, or ſeparate him from the love of God. Truth ſhall be tryed in thoſe veſſels of earth, though it be by fire ſeven times, and the furnace ſeven times hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than aforetime.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Sometimes the Lord doth, by theſe Tortures, aſſert and clear up the ſincerity and inward value and excellency of thoſe <hi>Virtues</hi> or <hi>Graces</hi> of Chriſt which are his own, and his admirable workmanſhip in their Souls. Theſe paſs up and down among men as meer deluſions from the Devil, and hypocriſie in the profeſſors of them. And now it is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the Lord's honour, and the vindication of the operation of the Spirit, that theſe be put upon ſome tryal that may ſearch their very root and bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, diſcover their foundation to the neck: When God ſpeaks of his Workmanſhip and Image in <hi>Job,</hi> Satan undertakes, if he could h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

He did attempt the green Tree, and its no marvel if he do the Dry. Now while he would bear God (if poſſible) and doth bear the World in hand ſo confidently, that he hath inſtruments of Cruelty, that would whip and kick the new-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in any man to nothing, and herein make God a Liar (as in the former) and an Impoſture (as in this) the Lord delivers the dearly beloved of his Soul into the enemies hand (though with ſufficient reſtrictions) Take him Torturer, try him to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, and when all comes to all, <hi>when he is tryed, he ſhall come forth as Gold;</hi> Job 23.10. And though till his word of deliverance came to his <hi>Joſephs,</hi> the <hi>word of the Lord tryes them, while their feet are hurt with fetters, and they be laid in irons,</hi> Pſal. 105.18, 19. <hi>They paſs through fire and water, yet he brings them into a wealthy place,</hi> Pſal. 66.10, 11, 12. Men and Devils ſhall know that the Faith, Love, Zeal, Patience, Courage, Holineſs, &amp;c. wherewith he hath endowed them, have that of Truth, Virtue, and Worth in them, as doth undeniably conſtitute them more excellent than their neighbours, and that an excellent Spirit is found in them, ſo as none of theſe tortures numbred up, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.35. to the end, is able to ſeparate betwixt them and their love to God, and uprightneſs with and before him.</p>

Sometimes the Lord doth by theſe Tortures take occaſion to heighten the honour of his own Power, Arm, and Influence, which are day by day adminiſtered to bear up his children, when it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt they have no external props to ſtay them up, but are <hi>out of weakneſs, made ſtrong.</hi> This brings out a more evident acknowledgement, That <hi>the power of Chriſt reſts upon them,</hi> 2 Cor. 12.9. <hi>God is in them of a truth,</hi> 1 Cor. 14.25. Its true, as long as times and providences hold to keep off pains from the body, chains from the legs, ſtripes from the back, famine from the belly, other props and principles may be preſumed to bear one up: but when there is no fruit in the Vine, no flock in the Field, no herd in the Stall, none ſhut up nor left, yet then to rejoyce in the Lord, to glory in tribulation, to accompt it all joy to fall into divers of them, and they great ones; this is convincing, that ſuch are kept, and kept up by the mighty Power of God; underneath ſuch muſt needs be everlaſting arms. What con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions came upon the two great Monarchs, by the great ſupport the three Worthies and <hi>Daniel (ch.</hi> 3. and <hi>ch.</hi> 6.) had from the Lord, to yield their bodies to torment! The former, becauſe they would not joyn with falſe worſhip; the other, becauſe he would not ceaſe practiſing the true: they gave glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the God of heaven, and upon all occaſions confeſs, that an excellent Spirit was found in them.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Sometimes the Lord brings about this end by it; he hereby brings forth a more plain and naked diſcovery of the wickedneſs that is in the world through luſt. Many times men come in upon Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, and the exerciſe of Power and Authority with moſt plauſible inſinuations, proteſtations and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:40849:21"/> declarations of their deſign and temper, as if no other than the diſpoſition of Lambs were in them, whereon they raiſe a name and repute of bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.25. or merciful Lords, and reckon it no ſmall part of their intereſt and buſineſs to raiſe and maintain in the ſpirits of people, the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of ſome indelible marks of the nature and majeſty of a Deity is ſtamped upon them, and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably, to get a reverence of them as moſt ſacred; when many times to open and undeceive the minds of poor ſouls held in ſuch blind devotion, the Lord lets them alone, and expoſes the bodies of his deareſt ones to their cruelty, that no man may glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in men above what is written, but that coming to a plain diſcovery of men and things in their own evidence, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.2. the ſons of men, as well as the children of God, may breath after the Lords ariſing to rule the earth, and become the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor among the Nations.</p>
                  <p>Thus we ſee for high ends, and unto glorious advantage ſome are tortured.</p>
                  <p>The Second Enquiry put, is, <hi>Why but ſome?</hi> men would be gratified, and if God be ſo honoured, <hi>why not all tortured?</hi> A few <hi>Reaſons</hi> may be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered here alſo.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There are but <hi>ſome tortured,</hi> becauſe God is pleaſed to accompt but <hi>ſome</hi> worthy to bear and wear the glory of being thus uſed for his Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake. There are <hi>ſome</hi> of whom the Lord ſaith, <hi>They ſhall walk with me in white, for they are worthy.</hi> Who are <hi>counted worthy</hi> to walk in white? Why, they who are come out of great tribulations, and have waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the <hi>lamb, Rev.</hi> 7.14. Though there be ſome points
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:40849:22"/> of honour, of which it may be ſaid, <hi>this honour have all the Saints,</hi> Pſal. 149.9. yet it holds not true in this that we ſpeak of, they who had the firſt ſtripes for the Name of Chriſt, <hi>rejoyced that they were count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed worthy to ſuffer ſhame for his Name,</hi> Acts 5.41. They have marks of diſtinguiſhing favour, who <hi>bear in their body the marks of the Lord Jeſus,</hi> Gal. 6.17. Alwayes carrying about in their body the dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Lord Jeſus, that the Life of Jeſus may ſo much the more be magnified and manifeſted in their mortal fleſh, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.10, 11.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>All are not tortured,</hi> becauſe the Lord ſees all of his Servants have not power to bear ſuch tryals; as all men have not faith, ſo all good men have not the like ſtrong faith, though they may have the like pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Faith. Their Faith may carry them to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, who yet may not have that degree and ſtrength of Faith to carry them through Tortures to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; not that they who have moſt, have any thing to boaſt of above others, as being better than they, the differance is only in beſtowing mercies, which are diſtributed variouſly even as the Spirit will, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.11. yet ſtill a proportion of tryal is mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured out ſutable to their ſtrength, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. for he knows our frames, and in meaſure doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate with us, and as the day is, ſo our ſtrength ſhall be, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.25. and even as there are children, young men, and Fathers in Chriſt, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.13. ſo have theſe their tryals as they can, and that they may be able to bear them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>All are not tortured,</hi> becauſe all are not <hi>called</hi> to be tortured; the Lord hath other imployments for ſome that ſhall as ſufficiently prove their faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, and improve their ſtrength, as if they had
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:40849:22"/> been tortured. Some of the Saints may as really honour God in a Meeting, as others of them may on a Gibbet, every member hath not the ſame of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice (<hi>Rom.</hi> 12.4. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. throughout) not the ſame imployment, ſhall not by the ſame manner of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or dying, glorifie God, <hi>John</hi> 21.19. God ſeeks for a man to ſtand in the gap, and make up the hedge, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22.30. Every man is not looked for in that place of danger: it's good to be where God looks for a man.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>All are not tortured,</hi> becauſe the Lord will be magnified in diſtributing the tryals of the body of Chriſt otherwayes than he did the tryals of their Head: its true, the tortures that were laid on him were to meet on him alone, he was to tread the Wine-preſs alone, and of all the people there was none to help him; they that thought they could drink the Cup he was to drink, or be baptized with his Baptiſme, did not underſtand themſelves: He looked and there was none to help, &amp; he wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there was none to uphold, therefore his own Arm brought him help, &amp;c. But now in the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip and ſimilitude of Chriſts ſufferings aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the body, although there be a compleatneſs of ſuffering appointed to the whole, of which the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.24. and though there be a common ſpirit of fellowſhip and ſimpathy of bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one anothers burdens, through which they are all baptized into one body; yet is there diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made of them, into the various parts, each member having that aſſigned him, which infinite wiſdom ſees proper for him, ſo that none may boaſt againſt others, as if he had no need of them; though <hi>Paul</hi> had laboured and ſuffered more than all, yet
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:40849:23"/> he had not ſuffered all, and could not ſay to the weakeſt, <hi>I have no need of thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. Laſtly, <hi>All are not tortured,</hi> becauſe the Lord will roll away the reproach, and remove the uſual ſtumbling-block which Satan raiſeth up to the tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the weak out of the way of the Lord; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That the enquiring after and profeſſion of Jeſus Chriſt, doth indiſpenſibly neceſſitate and bind over unto all manner of hardſhips; ſuch can never be in reaſonable expectation of good day more, but muſt bid adieu to all creature comforts, and eſpouſe the quite contrary extremities: its true, A dying to, a denying, nay, a hating of all our lower comforts is required to be learned in the beginning of their way who will be his Diſciples; But whether they ſhall be actually put upon that tryal, and really de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of them, is left to be diſpoſed of in the breſt and good pleaſure of him, who knows what part of the wrath of men, and ſuffering of Saints, will praiſe him; and the remainder he will reſtrain, the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute concluſion therefore of ſtumbling Sinners, and diſcouraging Saints, as if their bread would fail, and, as a Lion, he would break all their bones, are hence to be expelled, as having no juſt ground to be inſiſted on, as real obſtructions to our follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lord. Tempted Souls are apt to get their ſpirit quite worn out with a fearful expectation of the moſt fiery tryals, when as it may be the Lord hath appointed no ſuch thing at all for them, and in their following on in this way, they have met with little or nothing of what they feared. A few Practical <hi>Inferences</hi> here ſhall cloſe up the Point.</p>

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:40849:23"/> againſt thoſe ſurprizing amazements that are apt, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in ſuch dayes as theſe, to ſeize upon the ſpirits of people, who are looking toward <hi>Zion</hi> with their faces thither-ward; moſt good people are looking upon Penal Laws and Statutes made and making againſt them; if they hold on in ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion as they have made hitherto of Chriſt Jeſus, all muſt be baniſhed, all muſt be ſold as ſlaves, all muſt be impoveriſhed, impriſoned, or the like; Why then, <hi>ſaith a poor creature,</hi> what ſhal I do?

If it be but <hi>ſome</hi> that are Tortured, and they ſtand diſtinguiſhed by the abſolute ſovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and gracious diſpoſal of the Lord, who appoints their call, anointing, and ſeaſon, as it pleaſeth him; on whoſe will alſo the with-drawment of influences hereunto doth depend: Then it may caution you and me to take care how we judge of men that are aſſiſted, or not aſſiſted in point of <hi>enduring tortures.</hi> Its not the ſmalleſt infirmity of this day, there is a preſent over-valuing and under-valuing men and parties, according as there appears or diſ-appears
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:40849:24"/> an ability to endure the tortures, that attend the tryal of their profeſſion: <hi>The perſons of ſome are had in admiration becauſe of advantage above what is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; and the perſons of others ſo diſpiſed, as if God were not able to make them ſtand;</hi> that is a needful counſel in a caſe not very different, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.18. <hi>Boaſt not againſt the branches, for if thou boaſtest, thou beareſt not the root, but the root thee;</hi> and the teaching therein, hath been oftentimes enforced on me by that determination of our Lord, which is admitted frequently to take place at this day, <hi>Many that were laſt ſhall be firſt, and the firſt laſt:</hi> And it falls fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently under obſervation, That men, as well as things, do very ſpeedily and often, counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>march and ſhift places: Many tall Cedars, who did run well, ſuffer many things, gave great ground of perſwaſion that they would have gone thorough, have notwithſtanding at one point or other faultred, deſerted their ſtation, and (as <hi>Sampſon</hi>) grown weak as another man, when perhaps on the ſame ground a poor weak believer, over-looked and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed by moſt, <hi>hath obtained grace and ſtrength from on high,</hi> to make good that poſt, and to walk from ſtrength to ſtrength in the Name of the Lord his God.

Then let us learn to prepare our Faith and Patience, get on our Armour and gird it on; take heed how you be drawn into a ſleep of ſecurity from the preſent interval of Calm and Reſt, which the Lord is pleaſed hitherto to continue
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:40849:25"/> to you, in a very wonderful manner. Some are (if not tortured yet) ſorely tryed and tempted, while you have your mercies and opportunities ſo peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able about you; you ſhould be reckoning this is a ſpace allowed you to gather courage, not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract ruſt by reſt; but laying up a ſtore againſt the evil day, that queſtion ſhould be ſtill with us in a way of endeavouring its reſolution, <hi>Seeing we look for theſe things, what manner of People ſhould we be?</hi> ſtanding on our guard expecting to be drawn forth, and ready to comply with that Call, <hi>Who will riſe up for me againſt the evil-doers? who will ſtand up for me againſt the workers of iniquity?</hi> Pſal. 49.16. in a faithful, humble, Lamb-like readineſs to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Jeſus Chriſt, and witneſs for him, though it be in tortures, temptations, or wherever he goeth.</p>
                  <p>But to proceed to ſome farther Obſervations in the words, <hi>Others were tortured, &amp;c.</hi> It is imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make up the ſenſe at every ſentence, <hi>by Faith</hi> they were ſo, although it be not ſo expreſly named. By Faith they were tortured, by Faith they accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not deliverance; by Faith they looked for a better Reſurrection, all the famous doings, and fearful undoings recorded in this Chapter, are to the honour of Faith. This expreſſion therefore that comes firſt to hand, <hi>By Faith ſome were tortured;</hi> may be conſidered two wayes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It hath a great truth in it, if we thus under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it by Faith (that is by means of their Faith, upon this occaſion and for this reaſon) they were tortured, even their Faith; This was the quarrel the Devil and World had with them, <hi>viz.</hi> They were men of Faith. Or elſe,</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:40849:25"/>2. The expreſſion may be thus underſtood. <hi>By Faith they were tortured,</hi> that is, they were ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in and carried through their Tortures living or dying, by their Faith; <hi>This was the victory</hi> that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercame the world in all theſe tortures, <hi>even their Faith.</hi> I take this latter to be moſt immediately aimed at in this place, and ſutably is my eye to proſecute it. Though I take the former not to be excluded, or at leaſt we may draw ſome uſeful conſiderations from that ſenſe. <hi>By Faith,</hi> that is, upon occaſion of their Faith, they were quarrelled with, ſingled out, and tortured by Satan and his inſtruments: <hi>Great Faith expoſed them to great ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings:</hi> And ſo it is now, and may afford us this Obſervation.</p>
                  <p>Doct. 3. <hi>That a lively Faith poſſeſſed and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, is that which will enrage and engage the worlds higheſt violence and cruelty on him that hath it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I intend a very brief diſpatch of this (not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo immediately perhaps intended in the words) and that by conſidering Faith, as contracting and incurring this rage, in a two-fold ſenſe or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Conſider we this Faith unfeigned as it is <hi>poſſeſſed,</hi> or reſpecting its inward root and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, as it dwelleth in the hidden-man of the heart in that which is incorruptible; againſt this, and <hi>as ſuch,</hi> doth the Prince of Darkneſs mainly bend his batteries. Its true, he brings his torments to bear upon the limbs and members of the Body, the ſenſitive part; but nothing is more evident than that his deſign lies farther, as appears by this, That if by the frights or feeling of theſe tortures he can but get in pollution and defilement upon
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:40849:26"/> the ſoul of a poor Saint; if he can but corrupt that from the ſimplicity, or debauch that of the virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity it hath with Chriſt; then is the offence of the Croſs ceaſed, the torments are all called off, the work is done. He is mad to ſee any ſoul deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from his dominion, and tranſlated into the Kingdom of the dear Son of God, and there lives by this Faith on comforts, that he cannot inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medle withal; derives ſtrength and influence, which he cannot obſtruct; is acted in a life, and on principles, and reaſonings, which have a fixed and unalterable antipathy to his former courſes; nay, have vertue and ſucceſs to <hi>make reſiſtance to Satan, oftentimes to put him to flight,</hi> 1 Pet. 5.9. Jam. 4.7. And <hi>this is the Victory that ſo frequently overcomes, not only the World,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.4. <hi>but the Prince of the World,</hi> 1 Joh. 4.4. Now there is little reaſon that we ſhould wonder to ſee Satan rage, and in a rage to bring his inſtruments of greateſt cruelty to bear upon a ſoul that lives by Faith above him, and in ſuch an advantagious way of conqueſt over him, as the Gates of Hell cannot prevail to do him real harm, to bring him down from his excellency. But he ſtill ſtands on ground, and fights with inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that are inviſible and invincible; ſuch Births the Red Dragon watcheth to devour, caſts his floods after, raiſeth war againſt, upon this foot of account, <hi>They keep the Commandments of God, and the Faith of Jeſus.</hi> Upon this foundation alſo he exaſperates all his crew, acted by the ſpirit of this world, who are enforced to gnaw their tongues for pain, that in all their on-ſets from generation to generation, they could never come at, nor quell that ſpring and root of action and ſuffering, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:40849:26"/> they have been ſo perpetually baffled, and all their coſtly and promiſing attempts been brought to nought. Hence all their conſultations and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours reſolve themſelves into this iſſue, To rid the world of them who by a conſtant ſteady teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of their drawing vertue, as Olive-trees, from the God of the whole earth, being here in tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to them that dwell upon the earth.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We may conſider Faith in its <hi>Profeſſion,</hi> or the Profeſſion of our Faith; that is to ſay, not only as it inwardly unites a ſoul to Chriſt, whereby he draws forth conſolations and aids to do ſo wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully on Gods behalf; But alſo as it engages a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever to ſtand forth in the face of the World to teſtifie againſt it that its deeds are evil; bearing witneſs to the Holineſs and Faithfulneſs of God, in oppoſition to the ſtream of the luſts of men. Thus it contracts rage to the utmoſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.7. <hi>Me it hateth, becauſe I teſtifie of it that the works thereof are evil.</hi> When the whole demeanour of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, both in point of Worſhip and Converſation, is kept on, ſo as not to be tempted to fall down before the Idolatry on one hand, or fall in with the debauchery on the other, which is propoſed under Countenance, or impoſed by Law. The world can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bear the words of ſuch a people, <hi>Amos</hi> 7.10, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Can the abomination of a people be offered up before their eyes, and will not that Nation ſtone them? <hi>Exod.</hi> 8.26. In this matter the Diſciple is not priviledged above his Lord, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.18, 19. The world will hate ſuch a people, as it hated him, for witneſſing againſt their ignorance and ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Ye worſhip ye know not what! we know what we worſhip,</hi> Joh. 4.22. <hi>Ye are too ſuperſtitious: whom
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:40849:27"/> ye ignorantly worſhip, him we declare to you,</hi> Acts 17.22, 23. This is enough to get the world in an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roar. This is ſaid above, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.10. to torment them that dwell on the earth; theſe two Prophets that have no other weapons but the Blood of the Lamb, and the Word of their Teſtimony, the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Jeſus, which is the Spirit of Prophecy; and in this Meſſage, and under this Anointing, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſing, though in ſack-cloth, againſt the evils that are in the world through luſt, lighting them, as Gods Candleſticks, the way to heaven; this tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments men of earth. No wonder then that they torment you; why, your converſations, teſtimony, profeſſion of your Faith, torments them. <hi>Christ came not to ſend peace in the earth, but a ſword,</hi> Mat. 10.34. <hi>but a fire, and what if it be already kindled? Luke</hi> 12.49. Is Chriſt delighted with ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention? nothing leſs. But theſe are the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of the luſts of men, irritated occaſionally by the faithful rebukes of the Goſpel of Chriſt, and a practical profeſſion of the Faith thereof in ſuch as embrace and obey it.</p>
                  <p>A word or two of Practical Improvement, and I ſhall leave this Point.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe.</hi> 1. If Faith both in the <hi>Poſſeſſion</hi> and <hi>Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> of it, be apt to draw the rage of the world in the extremity of it upon you; this ſpeaks the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs of this Exhortation, that you give di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence to it, that the Faith any of you profeſs, be Faith <hi>unfeigned,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.5. Since, I ſay, Oh ye profeſſed Believers, your Faith in God, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to God, is that which you muſt expect will enrage the world againſt you; I beſeech you ſatisfie not your ſelves with any Faith ſhort of ſuch
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:40849:27"/> as will carry all the world in a way of victory be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it. I have thought that at this day there is no man ſo miſerable, as a profeſſor of Faith which is not right and real; he will contract the worlds rage, anger, and diſpleaſure, becauſe he profeſſeth ſome Faith; and he incurrs the Lords anger and diſpleaſure, becauſe he but profeſſeth, becauſe he hath not true Faith, <hi>Faith unfeigned.</hi> Intereſt in former dayes, led ſome to profeſs at an high rate, and their credit engageth them now not to fetch their turns too ſhort upon it; but the worlds rage chargeth them ſo hot in the rear, that they cannot hold it, but are forced in, by open Apoſtacy, to daſh themſelves againſt the thick Boſſes of his Buckler.</p>

                     <hi>Uſe</hi> 2. As it concerns you that your Faith be <hi>unfeigned,</hi> ſo the like reaſon and neceſſity ariſeth from the Promiſes, that your Faith be <hi>unmixed,</hi> in your preſent conteſt with the world: that is, that they may have nothing to charge you with, but your ſingle Faith, and ſuch things as are the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per off-ſpring of it, and of faithfulneſs to God upon it. It was the admirable advantage <hi>Daniel</hi> had againſt the greateſt Council that day in the world, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.4, 5. <hi>They could find no occaſion againſt him foraſmuch as he was faithful, unleſs they could find it againſt him in the Law of his God.</hi> The like had <hi>David</hi> againſt the envious and evil eye of <hi>Saul,</hi> that God was with him, and helped him in all his affairs wiſely and faithfully, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.12, 14, 15, 28, 29, 30. There was no occaſion adminiſtred to them that ſought occaſion. The contrary where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto is very detrimental to you, when they that purſue you have ground for that charge. <hi>Jer.</hi> 50.7.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:40849:28"/> 
                     <hi>We offend not, becauſe they have ſinned againſt the Lord the habitation of Juſtice, even God the hope of their Fathers.</hi> See the Spirits ſtrict caution againſt this, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20. <hi>What Glory is it, if when ye are buffeted for your faults, you take it patiently?</hi> ſee <hi>ch.</hi> 4.15. Oh it will be your bleſſedneſs, that they who purſue you, though they will not do it perhaps without a colour, yet they may do it without a cauſe, may have nought to charge you with than that which (when their vizor of Rhetorical elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence and invective malice is ſtript from it) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves its ſelf in a ſober gracious eye into this, it is for their being true to Jeſus Chriſt, their Faith in him, their ſubjection to him, their adhering to his Cauſe, Name, Works, Inſtitutions. Such a bottom will render you at length more than a Conqueror.</p>

                     <hi>Uſe</hi> 3. Take heed how you admit a Parley with thoſe Reaſonings, which tend to prejudice you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt believing, to make you think hardly, at leaſt to think ſlightly of Faith, in that it involveth you in ſo many dangers and perplexities. Satan lies at a Bay to poſſeſs you with offence, eſpecially in ſuch dayes as this: Chriſt tells you, <hi>Theſe things have I ſpoken that you might not be offended; Bleſſed is he that is not offended in me:</hi> But, Oh! how ſtrong are temptations to reaſon thus? why, this way of Profeſſing, of Meeting, of Exerciſing, is the high way to make me poor, a beggar, to undo me at laſt, and what ſhall I do then? Such Reaſonings have need be rejected with utmoſt abhorren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</p>

                     <hi>Uſe</hi> 4. Theſe Conſiderations ſhould ſweeten Heaven and Glory to us: If while we live by
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:40849:28"/> Faith, we draw the World, and ſuch a world of miſeries on us, it ſhould quicken the edge of our longings (not in a way of impatience neither) to be diſſolved and be with Chriſt, who is far better; <hi>Where ſorrow and ſighing ſhall flee away, where ſhall be no more death, neither ſorrow, nor crying, neither ſhall there be any more pain: for former things are paſt away,</hi> Rev. 21.4.</p>
                  <p>But to go forward to another Point. <hi>By Faith ſome were, &amp;c.</hi> Underſtanding it thus, that, <hi>by Faith,</hi> as the principle that bare them up and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried them through as conquerors, <hi>they were tortured.</hi> This ſenſe of it is moſt agreeable with the drift and deſign of the whole Chapter. The nobility of their Spirits commends the excellency of their Faith; To be tortured, and bear it patiently, is well; but ſo may many do from other Principles and Cauſes, they cannot tell poſſibly how to eſcape; but now to chuſe affliction with the people of God, to become companions of them that are ſo uſed, to improve what God doth in it, and think this is beſt of all; a Spirit thus managed, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaning its ſelf through the ſharps of it, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends the Fatih by which he doth it. <hi>By Faith they were tortured:</hi> the tortures on one hand, and temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings on the other, made no impreſſion, no altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on them, they were the ſame as formerly, or rather much better. <hi>By Faith</hi> they were ſo—. The Note is this.</p>

                     <pb n="40" facs="tcp:40849:30"/> two wayes wherein Faith contributes to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming this high ſervice.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Faith</hi> doth contribute to bear up under tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures themſelves (and much more under leſs try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, as impriſonment, baniſhment, &amp;c.) by way of evidencing things to the Soul, which otherwiſe are not ſo clear and ſubſtantial, as its the office of Faith to make them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Faith</hi> contributes hereunto, by way of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring influence and aſſiſtance to the ſoul, ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening and heartning it to indure that which otherwiſe would ſeem inſufferable, break and ſink the Spirit.</p>
                  <p>As for the former of theſe, Faiths proper ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to give light and evidence to the ſoul, and by evidence to beget a conquering magnanimity, commends it ſelf to us as its converſant about a three-fold object or imployment.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Faiths</hi> main evidencing work, is concerned about the grand Intereſt and Propriety that the Soul hath in God, and God in him; to get this caſe once cleared up beyond controverſie, and to maintain the ſoul in a ſatisfactory veiw of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in Chriſt. Where this is uncertain or cloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up, the ſoul ſets upon ſuch hazards with much trembling, and good reaſon it ſhould do ſo, all things conſidered. But where this Myſtery of Union and Relation to Chriſt is cleared, to and by believing, the ſoul becomes impregnable; as might be abundantly made out by that <hi>triumph of Faith,</hi> recorded exactly and accurately, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33. to the end. Can any of the inſtruments of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or cruelty there ennumerated, ſeparate ſuch a one from the love of God, who ſtands reſolved
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:40849:30"/> and undoubted upon Goſpel-grounds? nay, <hi>He is more than a Conqueror; Tribulation, diſtreſs, perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, famine, nakedneſs, peril, ſword, though all the day long we be killed and counted as ſheep for the ſlaughter;</hi> yet can none of theſe, managed either by men or Angels, do any thing of importance to the ſhaking of ſuch a one. When he arrives to that pitch of triumph, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.1. <hi>The Lord is my light and my ſalvation, whom ſhall I fear? the Lord is the ſtrength of my life; of whom ſhall I be afraid?</hi> You may gueſs how far he is hereby removed out of the way of danger: inroads may be made upon him, but he cannot be eaſily moved.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Faith</hi> hath another matter to clear up in a way of evidence, and by doing it effectually, it contributes exceeding encouragement to a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever to endure torments; namely, it evidenceth the Truth, and Goodneſs, and the ſpecial Relation that God hath to the Cauſe that it ſuffers in, from all the clouds, aſperſions, and calumnies that men would caſt upon it. I do not ſay that Faith can make a bad cauſe good, but it can make an obſcure cauſe clear. It is not enough that a Chriſtian have the clearneſs of a perſonal intereſt in the Lord, when he comes to endure torment; but it is needful that he have the clearneſs of a good Cauſe, and a good Call, that he ſuffers on, or elſe he may ſuffer as an evil-doer, and what thank will that be? the truth and goodneſs of his Cauſe needs then to be cleared; and Faith is of ſingular eſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy this way, when perhaps the wiſdom and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viliſh policy of men have been at work with op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probrious reproaches to viliſie it, or ſome time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving Apoſtates, with their ſophiſtical arguings,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:40849:31"/> and ſcholaſtical diſtinctions, as <hi>Jannes</hi> and <hi>Jambres,</hi> to invalidate and reſiſt the Truth; to which ſervice Scriptures and Arguments are not wanting to be wreſted, for the perverting the plain wayes of God, when the caſe is ſo, and a poor Chriſtian is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſo aſſailed and baited with them, that he knows not how to give a diſtinct, ſatisfactory, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing anſwer to all theſe ſophiſms; nay, perhaps cannot demonſtrably extricate himſelf from all the ſubtle entanglements that of this kind may be drawn about him. Now is it the office of Faith to clear up the innate goodneſs and truth of the principles it ſuffers on, that at leaſt to its own ſatisfaction the ſoul is abundantly cleared and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced therein, and united thereunto: And this hath helped the Martyrs of Chriſt to bear ſo bold a teſtimony to divers Truths, of which they were not able to make a ſcholaſtical defence by way of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, yet could ſet to their ſeal by dying, or ſuſtaining any tortures. — When this point is once ſatisfactorily evidenced, that the Cauſe is Gods, that Jeſus Chriſt is intereſted and imbarked in it, it gives ſtrong conſolation. What an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement was that, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.15. <hi>Be not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed at this great multitude; for the battel is not yours, but Gods.</hi> So was it to <hi>David</hi> with the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtine,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.47. <hi>The battel is the Lords.</hi> When a ſoul can ſee God not only intereſted with it, but really more deeply intereſted and concerned than its ſelf is, it yields full aſſurance of good ſucceſs at laſt. <hi>I know the Lord will maintain the Cauſe of the Afflicted, and the Right of the Poor,</hi> Pſal. 140.12. becauſe it can in title God to it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 74.22. <hi>Ariſe, O God, plead thy own Cauſe.</hi> This alſo will
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:40849:31"/> beget a dread on the ſoul, how it gives way to any temptation to betray it. This Truth, this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, however men call it little, however it may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Faith</hi> hath a further work to do in point of evidence, and thereby adminiſters abundance of ſtrength to a weak Chriſtian to endure any tortures for the Lords ſake, and that is, gives evidence of the real nothingneſs that there is in whatſoever the adverſary is able to do in point of torment, if the matter be indeed laid upon a right ballance, and held with an impartial and ſteady hand; and that in theſe Three reſpects:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Faith</hi> is called into Counſel, (in the exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the reaſonings of fleſh and blood) it mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſts abundance of winde and emptineſs in all the threatnings of the ſons of men; what they ſay of this kind, are but great ſwelling words of vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, an empty ſound, of little affrighting ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, <hi>Knoweſt thou not</hi> (ſaith <hi>Pilate) that I have power to crucifie thee, and power to releaſe thee?</hi> He
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:40849:32"/> would willingly have had his majeſty and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings very terrible; but what is Chriſt's anſwer? <hi>Thou couldeſt have no power except it were given thee from above.</hi> The power the Devil himſelf hath, though he be the Prince of the Air, cannot get o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver an hedge without ſpecial Commiſſion, <hi>Thou haſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </hi> (ſaith he concerning <hi>Job) made an hedge about him.</hi> Hence it is, that when their threatnings and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations have been to heat the Furnace ſeven times hotter; they feared not the wrath of the King, as ſeeing him that is inviſible, <hi>Our God whom we ſerve is able to deliver us,</hi> able to divert that fiery threatning; and if he will not do ſo, yet able to bring us out again. Theſe threatnings, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the cry for boldneſs.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Faith</hi> helps the ſoul to ſee that all their <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers</hi> and <hi>tenders</hi> of deliverance, of honour, of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment, or whatever elſe ſuch poor worms can mention, is as meer <hi>a vapour</hi> as the other: When Satan made the tender to Chriſt, <hi>All this will I give thee;</hi> all this power, ſaith he, will I give thee, and the glory of them, for that is delivered unto me, and to whomſoever I will give it; if there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou wilt fall down before me, all ſhall be thine, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.6, 7.

                     </gap>t Gods diſpoſe; here am I, let him do with me what ſeemeth good in his ſight: That which makes <hi>torments</hi> to be <hi>tortures</hi> indeed, is when the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers draw one way, and the mind another; but when the ſoul comes to be fully yielded up to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine pleaſure, this makes tortures become <hi>no tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> or at leaſt to become <hi>leſs tortures.</hi> You ſee this eminently ſet forth in the Captain of our Salvation himſelf, while he was crucifying in weakneſs, and tempted as are we, while the humane nature would have made choiſe of that requeſt, <hi>Father ſave me from this hour,</hi> Joh. 12.27. then was his Soul trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, all was dark and intollerable; But when he fixeth in that reſignedneſs, <hi>For this cauſe came I to this hour, Father glorifie thy Name;</hi> then are there not only Oracles of approbation, giving aid from the moſt excellent Glory, but the Baptiſm he hath before him, how is he pained ere it be accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And ſo in the very offering its ſelf, we ſee how his reſignation expedited his tortures, he was dead ſooner than the reſt: for when the Souldiers came to break the bones of the thieves, they brake
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:40849:34"/> not his bones; why? becauſe he was dead already. How ſo? Why he ſaid, <hi>It was finiſhed,</hi> bowed his head, gave up the Ghoſt, and ſaid, <hi>Father, into thy hands I commend my Spirit,</hi> Luke 23.46. Whereas the others abode in a conteſt till the laſt gaſp 'twixt ſpirit and members, loth to part, much work left undone, had no certainty (one at leaſt) of reſt for his ſoul. This makes ſore conflicts in times of torment; whereas on the contrary, how ſweet is that yielding up all to God, mentioned <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.5, 6. <hi>I was not rebellious, neither turned away back; but gave my back to the ſmiters, &amp;c.</hi> So <hi>chap.</hi> 53.7. <hi>He opened not his mouth, but is brought as a Lamb to the ſlaughter, &amp;c.</hi> This ſubduedneſs to the will of God, by the dominion of <hi>Faith,</hi> then is of exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moment to ſtrengthen us to the induring theſe <hi>torments.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Faith</hi> doth influence the ſoul to bear tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments notably, by bringing and encreaſing a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>greatneſs</hi> and nobility, a largneſs and publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <hi>of ſpirit</hi> on it more than formerly. <hi>Shall ſuch a man as I flee?</hi> Neh. 6.11. It begets a largeneſs of heart, in ſome degree anſwering that of <hi>Solomon,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 4.24. unto which a baſe ſhrinking is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding contrary and loathſome, eſpecially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering by, and for whom, and to the intereſt of whoſe Name it is engaged. Its marvelous to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what many have endured to gratifie the luſt of a great man, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.14, 15, 16. to provide for their families, to aſſert the liberties of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and the like; and is not the will, pleaſure, honour of Jeſus Chriſt of far greater moment to be witneſſed unto to the higheſt? It was a gallant ſpirit in <hi>Joab,</hi> which encouraged the people,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:40849:34"/> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.12. <hi>Be of good courage, let us play the men for our people, and for the Cities of our God, and the Lord do that which ſeemeth him good:</hi> The like rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings will Faith ſuggeſt to beget reſolutions. I have now an opportunity, which I may never have again, to play the man, the Chriſtian, the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, for my God, my Chriſt, for his Goſpel, his Inſtitutions, his Cauſe and Intereſt. What can be too hot or heavy to be done or ſuffered upon this accompt?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Faith</hi> influenceth notably in this matter, by giving the ſoul a proſpect into, and a fore-taſte of that better Reſurrection, realizing and rendring ſubſtantial the promiſed Glory thereof unto it. It's remarked of our Lord, that <hi>for the joy that was ſet before him, he indured the Croſs, and deſpiſed the ſhame,</hi> Heb. 12.2. <hi>Moſes,</hi> when he was threatned, indured, <hi>as ſeeing him that is inviſible,</hi> and <hi>having his eye to the recompence of reward,</hi> chap. 11.26, 27. <hi>They took joyfully the ſpoiling of their Goods, who know in themſelves they have in Heaven a better and more induring ſubſtance,</hi> chap. 10.34. <hi>Stephen</hi> looking ſtedfaſtly into Heaven, was not diſmayed at the frowns, threats, tortures of his fierce adverſaries, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.55, 56.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall only draw this into an Applicatory Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement briefly, and paſs along upon the whole of what hath been ſaid to this Head.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe.</hi> You are with a very loud voice, men and Brethren, exhorted and beſeeched, to give all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to the Concernments of your Faith. Above all your gettings, covet a true, lively, Goſpel-faith; above all your keepings, ſtrive to hold faſt, and contend earneſtly for this Faith. If ever there
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:40849:35"/> were dayes that called loud for the Life of the Faith of the Son of God, theſe dayes call for it. <hi>I had fainted</hi> (ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt) unleſs I bad believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:</hi> And truly you will be apt to faint in the day of adverſity, as if your ſtrength were ſmall where your Faith is not good. Take heed therefore of all things that may either adulterate it from its ſimplicity, or ſtop and obſtruct it from its growth. God hath begun to exerciſe your ſouls, and to prove your profeſſion in a way of tryals; its true, you have not yet reſiſted unto blood, unto tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as others have, and you (at leaſt ſome of you) may. The grand Queſtion your ſouls ſhould purſue to a full and ſatisfactory reſolution, is, What ſtock have you, proportionable to ſuch an expectation? Here I ſhall propound theſe Two Exhortations.</p>

                  </list>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Prove your Faith,</hi> or take it in the Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Examine your ſelves, whether you are in the Faith; prove your own ſelves:</hi> Do not take up principles upon truſt, perſwaſions of a good condition upon truſt, in a day when you are at the point of being put upon fiery tryals; <hi>Every mans work muſt be tryed;</hi> the time is come that judgument muſt begin at the Houſe of God. Every one muſt bear his own burden. Here you would be directed particularly to ſee, (1) That your <hi>Faith</hi> be true. (2) That your <hi>Faith</hi> be ſtrong. (1) That it be true; feigned <hi>Faith</hi> will beget but fading Comforts; nay, as was ſaid, It will do greater miſchief in ſuch a day, than no Faith at all. Here Evidences would be needful for diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:40849:35"/> and Arguments with Directions, for exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that ſouls who upon the tryal find themſelves ſhort, would not ſtrike off through diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; but rather ſtrike up with ſo much the more diligence to make their Calling and Election ſure, for helps, in order whereunto they muſt at preſent be referred to what hath been offered in other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes: The like might be offered to preſs you to look after ſtrength of <hi>faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Be exhorted, ſuch of you as find that good work of <hi>Faith</hi> with any power in your ſouls, that you do not let it lye by you, as a Talent in a Napkin, or as the Sword behind the Ephod, ſince there is none to it, to make you valiant to do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits: Oh! be much in this work of drawing it forth upon conſtant, quick, and lively exerciſe; as namely,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Improve your Faith againſt your Fears.</hi> It hath a ſoveraign and excellent vertue that way, in the experiences of all the Saints. As perfect Love caſteth out Fear, ſo doth perfect <hi>Faith;</hi> indeed it is <hi>Faith</hi> working by Love only doth it: <hi>What time I am afraid, I will truſt in thee. In the Lord I have put my truſt, I will not fear what man can do unto me.</hi> Have <hi>Faith</hi> upon its principallity of exerciſe, when the ſloods of ungodly men are apt to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Improve your Faith</hi> againſt all your offences and murmurings that you meet withal in your ſouls, occaſioned and multiplied by the ſtumbling-blocks of the day. Proper Doctrines cannot be preached, proper Duties cannot be practiſed, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Truths cannot be profeſſed, but Satan raiſerh up multitudes of Objections againſt them, of
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:40849:36"/> which this uſually beareth the maſtery, <hi>Spare thy ſelf;</hi> they reſolve themſelves into this uſually as their bearing reaſon, The fear of man. In ſuch a time, how needful is that Character to be found, <hi>Great peace have they that love thy Law, and Nothing ſhall offend them,</hi> Pſa. 119.165. When tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and perſecution for the Word cometh, how by and by men are offended, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.21. It was one great part of Chriſt's care at parting with his Diſciples, that they ſhould not be offended, at mens putting them out of the Synagogues, and thinking they do God good ſervice in killing them, <hi>John</hi> 16.1, 2. When <hi>John</hi> was in priſon, it is not eaſie to anſwer the queſtions, nor to remove the offences that ariſe upon it, Whether Chriſt be the Chriſt or no? <hi>But bleſſed is he</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>that is not offended in me,</hi> Mat. 11.6. Oh! improve your <hi>Faith</hi> againſt theſe ſtumbling offences.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Improve your Faith</hi> unto a full conqueſt of the World, and the things that are therein, reſpecting all the afrightments and allurements of it, as it preſents and preſſeth you with its objects of love and fear. Oh! in ſuch ſtaggering times, the dirt that clogs the feet of a Believer, the thick clay, that either in <hi>act</hi> or <hi>deſire</hi> he is buſied to load him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf withal, is extreamly detrimental to taking ſtreight ſteps to your feet: How eaſily did the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent evil World draw <hi>Demas, Judas,</hi> and divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to a betraying, denying, deſerting their high profeſſion? The victory that overcomes this (you have heard) is your <hi>Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Improve your Faith</hi> againſt all the filthineſs of the fleſh and of the ſpirit; let ſuch as name the Name of the Lord Jeſus depart from iniquity;
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:40849:36"/> a little ſin will deſtroy a great deal of valour, whereas holineſs carried on towards its perfection in the fear of God, will yield encreaſes of ſtrength and ſecurity againſt the worſt that man can do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, for <hi>who is he can harm you, if you be followers of that which is good?</hi> Holineſs will ſecure you from harm: They who torture you, if they cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file you, cannot deſtroy you; they may kill you, but cannot hurt you; you ſhall not be hurt of the ſecond death. And in as much as you are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſhewed what power <hi>Faith improved</hi> hath to promote holineſs, the Lord make you faithful here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>
                  <p>Thus far hath been ſpoken to ſet forth the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and admirable nature of believing, conſidered in its encounters with, and conqueſt over torments. It remains, that we now take into view its vertue and excellency, as it conflicts with, and gets ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs againſt another adverſary, no leſs difficult to be attempted than tortures be, no leſs apt to over-come, and that is, <hi>the tempting tenders of Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance.</hi> And herein is the greatneſs of the atchiev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that the <hi>Faith</hi> which enabled them to bear <hi>tortures</hi> without grudging, enabled them to refuſe the <hi>tenders of deliverance</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out complying.<note place="margin">

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:40849:37"/> the Rack, in ſuch a caſe when the ſinews begin to ſnap, and the joynts to ſever one from another; if nothing more were offered in the deliverance but meerly to let down the rack and take off the creature from the extremity of torment, though that may for a time ſeem to gain upon a meer man, yet ſuch may the caſe be, that ſuch deliverance may be worſe than death its ſelf: You reade in <hi>Rev.</hi> 9.5, 6. of a torment, in which men ſhall ſeek death, and ſhall not find it; and ſhall deſire to die, and it ſhall flee from them. Implying, that ſuch may be the <hi>torment</hi> on a poor creature, as that to be killed out-right, is better than to be ſpared; Knock me in the head rather than let me live thus in Torture. But the deliverance here is <hi>full deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance,</hi> a being reduced to a ſtate of eaſe, reſt, and quiet; together with any other accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that can be deſired to compleat it; All this will I give thee, Credit, Trade, Preferment, Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe, and what not?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>[They accepted it not.]</hi> They did not give it friendly entertainment, ſuch as one would ſhew to a ſtranger when he hath been long abſent. They were at ſuch a pitch of raiſedneſs, that they would give ſuch deliverance, deliverance <hi>on ſuch terms,</hi> not any friendly welcome, or entertainment, that other men, perhaps, would gladly do, they could not ſalute it, bid it, God ſpeed, could be in no fellowſhip with it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>[That they might obtain]</hi> The word doth not ſignifie any expectation, that they had, or could have of dealing with the hope of the Reſurrection upon the terms of ſtrict merit. As if there were any equality or proportion betwixt their enduring
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:40849:37"/> 
                     <hi>tortures;</hi> and their receiving the <hi>Reſurrection;</hi> nay, when they have done all, left all, ſuffered all, they are unprofitable ſervants; but only thus, in thus ſtanding under <hi>torments,</hi> thus withſtanding deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance upon unworthy terms, they were in the Lord's path of expecting the comfortable fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtes now, and aſſurances of a further glory.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>[A better Reſurrection] Paul</hi> preſſed hard to obtain the Reſurrection from the dead, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.11. which is not only a Reſurrection of the dead, <hi>both of the just and unjust,</hi> but that which is called, <hi>the firſt Reſurrection,</hi> Rev. 20.6. for, <hi>the dead in Chriſt ſhall riſe firſt,</hi> 1 Theſ. 4.16. <hi>They which are Chriſts at his coming,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.23. <hi>For them that ſleep in Christ, ſhall God bring with him.</hi> This is called the <hi>Better Reſurrection;</hi> not only better than their <hi>tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> but better than their proffered Deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
                  <p>The main Point that I ſhall propound to be handled from the words, is this;</p>
                  <p>Doct. 5. <hi>That it is no leſs the excellency of Faith to reject the tempting Tenders, than to ſuſtain the cruel Tortures of a trying Day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſuppoſition is of a perſon put upon this <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemma,</hi> he is brought into a condition of <hi>torturing,</hi> be it <hi>actually</hi> ſo to his feeling, or only <hi>vertually</hi> in the threats or Laws that repreſent them at hand, or to his fears. In this condition he hath two <hi>offers,</hi> two <hi>tenders</hi> made to him: Firſt, the <hi>tender</hi> of the <hi>Torturer,</hi> and he offers Deliverance, full and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat deliverance. Secondly, the <hi>tender</hi> of the <hi>Comforter,</hi> and he offers the Reſurrection. And now the man is put to it, <hi>Will you comply with the deſign of the Torturer, and you ſhall have Deliverance?</hi>
                     <pb n="56" facs="tcp:40849:38"/> Or, <hi>will you adhere to the deſign of the Comforter, and you ſhall have</hi> (perhaps not any eaſe, mitigation, but rather an increaſe of pain; But) <hi>at length, a lot in the end of the dayes, in the Reſurrection?</hi> Look to your choice, let your choice be the off-ſpring of a well-deliberated and digeſted judgment upon the caſe. Now here lies the excellency of believing, in fixing the ſoul upon principles of the higheſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; to cleave to this <hi>(the Reſurrection)</hi> is better. When ſenſe comes in with its judgment, life is ſweet, <hi>Skin for skin, and all a man hath he will give for his life. The body is more worth than food, and the life than raiment. Death is a King of terrors.</hi> Baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is terrible, tortures intollerable, hunger in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferable; <hi>Spare thy ſelf,</hi> this evil ſhall not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take thee. What ſaith Friends, Wife, Children, <hi>Oh! do not diſgrace your ſelf, do not deſtroy us; men will praiſe thee when thou doſt well for thy ſelf.</hi> But what ſaith <hi>Faith?</hi> [Ah, will a carnal heart ſay, I hate him, for he never ſpeaks good to me, but evil.] Well, but what will it ſay? Why, there is a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Reſurrection that will repair all <hi>tortured bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, tottered limbs, maſſacred members,</hi> will all be done up better in the Reſurrection? And in mean time, theſe light afflictions are but for a moment, and not worthy to be compared with that glory which is ready to be revealed in us. Scorn the <hi>torturer,</hi> ſlight the <hi>tender;</hi> reject the <hi>offer</hi> at man's hand, it is and hath a lye in the right hand: fall into the hands of the Lord, commit the keeping of thy ſoul to him in well-doing, as into the hands of a faithful Creator: be aſſured he is able to keep that which is committed to him againſt that day. This is an hard ſaying, fleſh cannot bear it, but faith can and doth.</p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:40849:38"/>
                  <p>Now, that we may not miſcarry or offend on the right hand nor on the left in this narrow point, I ſuppoſe it may be requiſite to draw the matter thus into Conſideration; Deliverance from <hi>tortures,</hi> and conſequently from any <hi>other,</hi> or <hi>leſſer tryals,</hi> may be conſidered Three wayes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In a ſimple and abſtract Notion in its ſelf, unclothed of other circumſtances and dependen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and then we ſhall ſee what acceptance Faith will give to it when tendered.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We are to conſider Deliverance as in the <hi>tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers</hi> hand and deſign, as an Engine or Inſtrument to carry on the ſame end, which he <hi>attempted</hi> to extort by <hi>torments;</hi> namely, to bereave the man of his Teſtimony.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We may conſider Deliverance, as it ſtands compared with, and oppoſed to the <hi>better Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection;</hi> theſe Two ſtanding in competition in their <hi>tender.</hi> —</p>
                  <p>Now in each of theſe reſpects, there are ſeveral conſiderable Truths to be taken notice of, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in ſuch times of <hi>attempts,</hi> to debauch all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of wayes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For firſt of all, If we conſider Deliverance apart from the projects and deſigns of men, who are <hi>tempting</hi> and <hi>attempting</hi> by it, to bring about their ends, upon a <hi>poor tortured</hi> Child of God; I ſay, take it in a ſingle and abſtract notion, apart from ſuch entanglements, and the matter admits of a very vaſt difference in the judgment, and to the acceptation of <hi>Faith.</hi> For if the caſe can be clearly and truly ſo ſtated, <hi>Faith</hi> can and muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept deliverance with all thankfulneſs, with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to God, and with great advantage to the ſoul
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:40849:39"/> concerned in it. — And therefore as we paſs along, I would willingly ſpeak a little diſtinctly to this caſe, that ſome ſtop and prevention may be put to the prejudice, that may otherwiſe ariſe upon a rigid inſiſting on this Doctrine; as if the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of <hi>Faith</hi> in times of tryal, were inevitably to run all upon the Rocks, without any reſpect had to the preſerving our ſelves, or any thing concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning us, or committed to us of our external mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. Being therefore the contrary is to be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and is implyed all along under the main Truth aſſerted in the Text; I will fairly lay down this Suppoſition:</p>
                  <p>☞ <hi>That Deliverance</hi> (as Deliverance may be conſidered) <hi>is a Mercy not to be refuſed, but accepted by Believers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Deliverance from <hi>tortures,</hi> from <hi>tryals,</hi> if you would think of it very abſtractly, and in its meer ſimple nature; Deliverance from harm and evil may be reckoned among a Chriſtians middle things, I mean ſuch things as in their own nature are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good nor evil, but do receive the impreſſion &amp; denomination of good or evil, ſutable to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, improvement, or deſign to which they are bent and levelled, accordingly as they are either uſed or abuſed. And therefore it is that the Spirit of the Lord (<hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9. beginning) declares that there is neither love nor hatred by all that of this kind is under the Sun. But in this ſenſe it falls not immediately under our preſent diſcourſe. A little farther therefore. — Deliverance to a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian repreſents it ſelf ſo, as he can clearly and comfortably eye it in God's hand, and as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing conveyed to him by the goodneſs of a good
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:40849:39"/> God. And when deliverance can be thus beheld, not only as coming in a common effective provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, but by the approbation, allowance, and good will of the Father, then ſuch deliverance is entertained with the beſt acceptation of <hi>Faith,</hi> he compaſſeth God about with ſongs of deliverance. To this Point a little may be ſpoken. There are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral reſpects in which no man is ſo capable to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Deliverance, ſuch Deliverance, as a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>None, as he, can tell what to make of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>None, as he, knows how to improve De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>None, as he, can accompt with God for it at the last Day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Firſt of all; When Deliverance comes in, in ſuch a way as he may accept of it, none is able to make ſo much of it, put ſuch a value upon it as he; every thing on this ſide Hell is Mercy. It's of the Lord's mercies we are not conſumed. <hi>Faith</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanceth the value of every received good, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the love that ſent it, the price it coſt, the grace that brings it; it ſayes as <hi>Jacob, I am leſs than the leaſt of all thy mercies,</hi> Gen. 32.10. <hi>What am I, that thou haſt brought me hitherto?</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.18. It traceth out, and owneth the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps of divine good-will in every little thing, and much more when it ſees ſuch ſalutations: Life is a mercy, Liberty a mercy, exemption from Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures a great mercy, Deliverance out of them a greater mercy. Hence the Soul is compaſſed, and compaſſeth his God about with ſongs of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="60" facs="tcp:40849:40"/>2. None knows how to improve a Deliverance, how to uſe it when he hath it, as a Believer: If he have Life on this ſide Death, Liberty on this ſide Bonds, Eaſe on this ſide Torment, he is taught to acknowledge and reckon he is not his own in it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.19, 20. but muſt uſe it to the glorifying God in ſoul and body, which are his. None is under ſuch obligations, none hath ſuch objects and opportunities to make an high improvement of them as he hath who by believing looks into them, others beſtow them on their luſts.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. None, as he, knows what account he muſt give to God for ſuch Deliverances: as he muſt reckon for every idle word, and all the deeds done in the body, ſo he muſt yield an account of all his receipts whatever they be, and therefore muſt ſo receive and improve as one that muſt be judged by the Law of Liberty; and hence durſt not ſay of any Mercy as they, <hi>Our tongues are our own, who is Lord over them?</hi> Pſa. 12.4. On theſe accompts, and others that might be mentioned, the Believer hath reaſon to know deliverance, the worth that is in it, and his duty about it, more than any other. Now as none can deal with deliverance as they, ſo is it a very high duty incumbent on ſuch to receive deliverance at the hand of God; then to accept de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance is his duty, and to give it ſuch acceptance and entertainment in Truth, as he expreſſed in Complement, and in a ſtrain of Oratory &amp; Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick, <hi>Acts</hi> 24.2, 3. the terms only changed: the Believer may thus expreſs himſelf to the Lord; Seeing I enjoy great quietneſs, (great deliverance, great preſervation) and that very worthy deeds are done to ſuch a worm as I, by thy Providence, I
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:40849:40"/> accept it <hi>alwayes,</hi> and <hi>in all places</hi> (my dear Father) <hi>with all thankfulneſs.</hi> None do and can give it ſuch acceptable entertainment as the Believer of whom we treat. The matter therefore thus ſtated and conſidered, he doth not, he durſt not refuſe ſuch deliverance: For if he ſhould not thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He were, in this refuſal, a meer deſtroyer of himſelf; a thing abhorrent to godlineſs: he were, I ſay, acceſſary of the violence done upon himſelf. <hi>Saul</hi> is as guilty of his own death, if his Armour-bearer thruſt him through, as when he falls upon his own Sword. If Life, Liberty, or any Mercy may be had in God's way, the refuſal of it is the deſtroying our ſelves ſo far as that Mercy extends. Though we are required to hate Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and our own Lives, in a ſence, yet it is far from the intendment of the Spirit we ſhould care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly run them upon hazard: no, ſuch know their bodies are the Temples of the Holy Spirit, and they ought to uſe them well for his ſake who dwells in them: He that abuſeth the Temple of God, him will God deſtroy.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Such a refuſal of Deliverance, when it may be had in the Lord's way, is a manifeſtation and an act of the higheſt ingratitude and unthankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the Lord that can be thought on. To ſcorn or ſet at nought his favours, is very much beneath the ingenuity of a Believer; who ought to imbrace all occaſions to ſhew forth the high praiſes of the Lord, which are due unto his Name. Bleſſed are ſuch as dwell in the Lord's Houſe, they have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent ſuch occaſion to be praiſing him, and it is comely for the upright.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="62" facs="tcp:40849:41"/>3. Should he not accept Deliverance, when it may be had in the Lord's way, it would be found an act of high violence and injuſtice towards o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who may be involved and concerned equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with themſelves. Some have Wives, and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, or other Relations, in the fleſh; now, as <hi>if he provide not for his own, and eſpecially for them of his own houſhold, he were worſe than an Infidel,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.8. So if he draw them into ſufferings, from whence he might have deliverence in a way honourable and acceptable to the Lord, he is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary of their miſery, their wrong will be upon him. — More of this kind might be ſpoken, but I fear too much of it is ready to be alledged on the common principle, which is fruitful in ſuch kind of reaſonings: <hi>Save thy ſelf, ſpare thy ſelf;</hi> this harm ſhall not come unto thee, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.22. I ſhall only draw this Conſideration into ſutable Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in a few Inferences.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If this be ſo, then may we take up this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, That Godlineſs, and the profeſſion of it, doth not inevitably run and neceſſitate a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian upon the hazard and loſs of every thing he hath, or induce him to caſt away all: Though it doth indeed require him to prepare his ſtuff for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving, to ſtand crucified in his affections unto them, and ready to make ſurrender of them when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Lord needs them (as was ſaid of the Colt) or is pleaſed to call for them; yet it alſo directs to an excellent way of receiving, enjoying, and uſing them; buying as if he bought not, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and uſing all theſe as not abuſing them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.29, 30, 31. Do not therefore take up hard thoughts of Godlineſs, becauſe of the Doctrine of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:40849:41"/> Self-denyal, the Croſs at entrance, or the Tryals and Tribulations that are appointed to attend the Profeſſors of it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Hence it will alſo follow, That falſe and wrong Principles are not to be accompted good, becauſe perſons do, upon them, run all they have upon ruine. As there is a kind of reſpect and pity kindled in tender and ingenious hearts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward a people who ſuffer under the profeſſion of principles that have an appearance of Holineſs in them: So doth a kind of ſtedfaſtneſs to thoſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and reſolution to run all things to ruine on them, very much tend to raiſe admiration and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe to ſuch a people and their profeſſion: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as on the contrary, I deſire you to take this as a ſtanding Rule;</p>
                  <p>☞ <hi>That the goodneſs of a Principle is not to be tryed and determined by the reſolution of the Sufferer, but the reſolution of the Sufferer by the goodneſs of his Principle.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Good-men may be very weak under good Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and Bad-men may be very heady and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute under bad principles; and this well conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, would lead off our eyes from gazing on, and having mens perſons in admiration upon one hand when we ſee them ſtand, or being apt to judge them and their cauſe if we ſee them inſident in hours of temptation to ſhake and totter.</p>
                  <p>I confeſs its very beautiful and deſireable to ſee ſtedfaſtneſs of Soul, as the off-ſpring of Truth, fixed there in Goſpel-evidence; and the contrary hereunto, hath given not a little advantage and occaſion to weak ones, to queſtion almoſt every thing, whether there be any thing of Truth in it,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:40849:42"/> ſeeing the generality of all Profeſſors have been in the entrance on this Tryal, ſo hardly fixed to any thing that endangereth the loſs of their exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal accommodations. If it be enquired, <hi>Why ſo many ſhrink, and totter, who profeſs the Truth?</hi> I anſwer: It doth not argue that their Principle was naught, and ſo the cauſe of their tottering; but their ſtanding upon that principle was not ſound, they were not joyned to the things they profeſſed, they were not <hi>mixt with Faith,</hi> Heb. 4.2. There are many principles on which many have adventured their <hi>All,</hi> and endured great <hi>Tortures,</hi> and yet no <hi>truth</hi> or <hi>ſoundneſs</hi> in them. See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.3. <hi>Though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it were nothing.</hi> Which implyeth a poſſibility, on hollow and unſound bottoms, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed thus far, and yet find no acceptance with God at all in it. We may conſider a few Principles that will carry men to endure <hi>torments,</hi> and yet not ſuch as we may juſtifie.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Firſt, there is <hi>Self-Righteouſneſs;</hi> a deſign to eſtabliſh a man's own Righteouſneſs in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt in the Goſpel: its wonderful to conſider what <hi>tortures</hi> it will wade through in compaſſing its deſign. You know that Obſervation the Apoſtle makes of it, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.23. where ſpeaking of the attempts made to deceive and ſpoyl Chriſtians of the ſimplicity of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, partly by the Heatheniſh Philoſophy, and partly by Jewiſh Superſtition, they meet in this, <hi>A ſhew of wiſdom they have in Will-worſhip, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, neglecting the Body, not in any honour to the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying the fleſh.</hi> Fleſh will be ſatisfied, and a deſign of fleſh carried on vigorouſly, to promote
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:40849:42"/> its righteouſneſs, though it be in a neglecting, diſhonouring, offering violence to the body. Men have, and do admit great hardſhips on their body, to promote the righteouſneſs of the fleſh.</p>
                  <p>Again; Another principle that will carry men through ſufferings wonderfully, is, <hi>the luſt of the fleſh:</hi> when there is ſome untamed luſt that ſeems to be croſt by ſufferings, and eſpecially if it can be hid under the cloak of ſome profeſſion. As for inſtance; the Pride and Ambition of a man, where it rageth and is unmortified, it will ruſh and make a noiſe a great while through ſufferings. Such a man will ſcorn to be ſaid to bow, to be called a <hi>Turn-coat,</hi> to yield to ſuch a ſubdued unworthy generation. So likewiſe headineſs, frowardneſs, where it takes head and heart, it will ruſh as the Horſe into the battel: <hi>The Counſel of the froward is carried headlong,</hi> Job 5.13. Its maſter-piece is blind madneſs.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Moreover, <hi>Strong affections to the perſons of men, and admiration of them, becauſe of advantage.</hi> The Diſciples would go and die with <hi>Lazarus, Joh.</hi> 11.16. They would follow Jeſus into Priſon, and into Death, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.33. Affections led <hi>Peter</hi> upon the Waves for Chriſt's company, but could not keep him from ſinking. Many would go to the ends of the Earth, for the love they bear to ſuch a Miniſtry, to ſuch a People, &amp;c. But if this be the height and ſtrength of it, it will abate and decay upon ſharp tryal.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Laſtly, <hi>When a man's caſe becomes deſperate, as Saul:</hi> Men will fall upon their Sword; <hi>Judas</hi> hang himſelf; Men will deſire to die, and it flees from them.</p>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:40849:43"/>
                  <p>Upon the whole this Concluſion iſſueth forth; The goodneſs of a man's Bottom, Spirit, Cauſe, or Principle, is not to be concluded from the reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luteneſs of his ſtanding; and on the contrary, other wayes muſt be ſought to determine and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the badneſs of a Principle, beſides the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy of Profeſſors from it. <hi>All they that were in</hi> Aſia <hi>forſook</hi> Paul, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. <hi>At his firſt Anſwer, no man ſtood by him,</hi> ch. 4.16. <hi>All ſcattered to their own from Christ,</hi> Joh. 16.32. <hi>Sought their own things, and not the things which are Jeſus Chriſts, Phil.</hi> 2.21. And yet Truth's profeſſed by them ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the worſe for all this. Let's then be leſs raſh in judging them and their ſtanding, taking heed rather leſt we fall; God is able to graft them in, and make them ſtand again: Deliverance when God may be ſeen bringing it, and enjoyed in it, ought to be accepted, and <hi>Faith</hi> fitteſt to give the beſt acceptation to it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2dly. But to paſs this by, my aim in the next place principally, is to conſider Deliverance as it is in the <hi>tempters</hi> hand, as an offer of his, and as in deſign to carry on the ſame projects, that he had in the Torment, and that is, To enſnare and debauch the perſon, when the Tortures have made ſuch a breach upon the members, as the Tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thinks he hath cauſed ſome impreſſion by way of deſpondency on the mind, that he ſuppoſeth former reaſonings are ſomeway weakned, and former reſolutions abated; now is Deliverance tendered as a bait, to draw the ſoul off from its ſtedfaſtneſs. Now <hi>Faith</hi> is of power to interpoſe, to relieve the <hi>poor, tortured, tempted ſoul,</hi> ſetling it upon the power of God, and by gathering up his
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:40849:43"/> ſpirits to help him to make that gallant repulſe, that honourable refuſal to it in all its painted and alluring beauty; I ſcorn your Deliverance, Got behind me Satan, thou art an offence to me. You have the excellency of <hi>Faith</hi> deſcribed in other ſubjects (<hi>verſ.</hi> 37.) <hi>They were ſtoned, they were ſawn aſunder,</hi> They were tempted, <hi>were ſlain with the ſword:</hi> Among other conqueſts of believing, this was not the leaſt, that in the mideſt of other cruel Tortures, <hi>they were tempted,</hi> and yet were conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors. How tempted? Why, as is ſaid above, (<hi>v.</hi> 15.) they had opportunities to have returned, to have eſcaped; and this was the nobility of their ſpirits, they ſlighted ſuch opportunities, when temptation lay in opportunities. We are therefore here to obſerve this further Suppoſition, to be implyed in the former aſſertion; ☞ <hi>That the faireſt offers of Deliverance in a Torturers hand, may carry the fouleſt deſigns of Temptation in them;</hi> and then is <hi>Faith</hi> eminently concerned to take heed of them, and reſiſt them. Indeed, if perſons will be by no means perſwaded to look otherwayes than on the out-ſide of the offer, it is not ſtrange if they take, if ſuch ſwallow them down, as the unwary Fiſh doth Hook and all; but if they belong to God, they muſt vomit them up again, God ſhall caſt them out of their belly. When God hath a ſoul under the Rod, upon the Rack, in meaſure, when it breaketh forth he will debate with it, he ſeeks to make impreſſions by frequent ſolicitations, to get entrence by ſome means or other for his deſigns of grace and holineſs; which he doth gradually chafe in this way, <hi>Job</hi> 33.14, 15, 16, 19, <hi>&amp;c. ch.</hi> 36.8, 9, 10. In like manner, though, with a differing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:40849:44"/> when Satan can but have the winnowing, (<hi>Luke</hi> 22.31.) and hampering of a child of God, (<hi>Job</hi> 1.11, 12. <hi>ch.</hi> 2.5, 6.) his whole deſign is to make impreſſions of pollution, <hi>Curſe God and die, let go thy integrity;</hi> and the remembrance and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience he hath how many ſtrong men have fallen this way, encourageth and emboldens him to deal frequently this way. As we ſee thoſe inſtruments of his did with <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> ch. 20.10. <hi>All my fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers watch for my halting; peradventure he will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed, and we ſhall prevaile againſt him, and take our revenge on him. Sampſon</hi> had a great ſpirit, and by plain force could not be ſubdued, but a <hi>Dalilah</hi> is prevalent to enſnare him. <hi>David</hi> ſhall have <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal</hi> given him to Wife, but in deſign that ſhe may be <hi>a ſnare</hi> to him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.21. There being <hi>no Inchantment againſt</hi> Jacob, nor <hi>Divination againſt</hi> Iſrael. <hi>Balaam</hi> the Son of <hi>Beor,</hi> gives counſel, to take <hi>Iſrael</hi> in a way that had more of Efficacy to divide betwixt them and their God, than could be expected from <hi>Balacks</hi> fighting them, or <hi>Balaams</hi> curſing them, <hi>Micah</hi> 6.5. <hi>Numb.</hi> 25.1, 2, 3. <hi>Every man is tempted when he is drawn aſide of his own lust, and inticed, &amp;c.</hi> James 1.14, 15. By theſe wayes is a poor ſoul overcome, and brought into bondage frequently, when open violence will do but little harm on him. Now the attempts of the enemy in ſuch a ſeaſon, when the poor man is in the fear or feeling of Torture, are carried on one of theſe Two wayes:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Sometimes ſo groſs is the Deſign, ſo apparent is the Project to debaſe, and debauch, as every eye may ſee it, and he that runs may reade it: and conſequently ſo, as the common reaſon of men,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:40849:44"/> not only may detect it, but offer relief againſt it; when Violence ſpringeth up into a Rod of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, it is uſually thus, and then the eſcape and conqueſt is more eaſily obtained: the very prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of humanity guiding a man in his choice and refuſal. <hi>In vain</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 1.17.) <hi>is the Net ſpread in the ſight of any Bird.</hi> When the Project lies ſo open, as Reaſon and Morality dictate and aſſiſt againſt it, its not then ſo properly attributed to <hi>Faith</hi> to do it. — But,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Satan's Project is many times carried on ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry covertly, and lies hid and concealed under ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny very ſpecious ſhews and pretences; the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of ſtanding out, the reaſonableneſs of yiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and complying, are ready to be diſputed with much demonſtration. Now when really the caſe is thus, and the ſnares of Satan are thus couched and latent, the ſoul is only preſerved by the meer grace of God, and <hi>Faith</hi> comes to be magnified in the glory of its operation: for ſhort of that, &amp; while <hi>Faith</hi> is not upon its quick exerciſe, the ſoul is ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, ere ever it is aware, to be taken and carried away, his reaſon lyable to captivity; and the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of theſe Cavils may divide the man within himſelf, againſt himſelf. To be in a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of reſolving all theſe Doubts and anſwering, or at leaſt ſtilling &amp; ſilencing all theſe Objections, on the ſide of Truth. This ſpeaks the victory of <hi>Faith,</hi> and proclaims the man a Believer indeed. Of this there is a very pregnant Inſtance in this Chapter, in the caſe of <hi>Moſes,</hi> verſ. 24, 25, 26. The deliberations of his mind are expreſt in acts of Chuſing, Refuſing, Eſteeming; all which were imployed in weighing a caſe very like this, of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:40849:45"/> which the Text treateth. He refuſed Deliverance and Preferment, with all the Accommodations imaginable; and imbraced Afflictions, Reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, Sufferings; not as out of direct neceſſity, but as of choice, upon terms that muſt neceſſarily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him to the common Cenſure of Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</p>
                  <p>We may weigh and accommodate to our uſe ſome Circumſtances in that affair. <hi>He refuſed to be called the Son of</hi> Pharaohs <hi>Daughter.</hi> Its ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and moſt probable, <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Daughter was Heireſs to the Crown of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and having no Children, would have adopted <hi>Moſes</hi> as her Son, to entitle him to the Succeſſion of the Crown of <hi>Egypt,</hi> or at leaſt to advance him to an high capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of Honour and Dominion in that Court. Now all this he refuſeth; not only diſ-eſteems, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies to touch with it; and this not on a fit, or in a heat, as a youthful frollick; for the Spirit notes it to be when he was come to years; And <hi>Acts</hi> 7.22, 23. <hi>He was learned in all the Wiſdom of the</hi> Egyptians, <hi>mighty in words and in deeds: and when he was full</hi> 40 <hi>years, it came into his heart, &amp;c.</hi> All which ſhews him to have been, both as to his Age, and the ripeneſs of his Underſtanding, every way capable of putting forth acts of mature and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate Conſideration, eſpecially in a matter of ſuch moment to him. Well, thus capacitated, he Refuſeth that, and it, not meerly to exchange for a retired contemplative way of living, wherein he might more deſireably accommodate his noble <hi>genius,</hi> by being ſequeſted from the noiſe &amp; ſenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alities of the Court; But, <hi>He chuſeth to ſuffer Afflictions with the people of God:</hi> their ſtate at this
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:40849:45"/> time was very terrible in the Iron furnace, where he could expect at beſt nothing but laſh and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: both which muſt needs be the more irkſome, for that he had not been bred, or accuſtomed to them: but he ſtands fixed in his choice, as upon an eſtimate of things on all hands, in which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes he had the better bargain, <hi>Eſteeming the Reproach of Chriſt greater treaſure than the riches of Egypt, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It might be eaſie to repreſent to our ſelves, what abundant Reaſon, according to fleſh and blood, would ſtand up againſt this choice of his. Would not <hi>Sence</hi> have ſaid, Never make this Choice, you will never be able to endure the Brick-kilne, the cruel Task-maſters, the hard fare of Onions and Garlick, who have been bred ſo delicately, fed ſo deliciouſly, clad ſo honourably? Would not <hi>Policy</hi> have ſaid, Never make this Choice, it will ſavour of a deſign, That you intend to grow popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar among an heady mutinous Nation; you purpoſe to take your advantage to rebel againſt the King, to ſhake off the yoke of Servitude; you are known at Court, and will be eyed, and incur the wroth of the King above any man in <hi>Egypt,</hi> Keep your ſtation, meddle not with Changes, now the eyes and expectation of all begin to be fixed on you? Would not <hi>Parents,</hi> and <hi>Friends,</hi> have ſaid, Make not this Choice, you will utterly over-throw our fortunes, to which you may now be probably in a capacity to raiſe us; in this your act you will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve us under the ſame cloud, and common hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and ſuffering with your ſelf; and to be made miſerable by the hand that we expect advancement by, is a double miſery? Would not <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the beſt
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:40849:46"/> and wiſeſt of them ſay, Oh! whatever you do, make not that Choice; Now you are in a fair pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability to do us good in a publick capacity: You may <hi>be Pharaoh!</hi> and then may let <hi>Iſrael</hi> go: at leaſt, you may be another <hi>Joſeph,</hi> a Second in the Kingdom; and in that capacity may obtain, if not a reſcinding, yet a relaxing of the rigour of the Laws that bind our burdens ſo inſufferably upon us, that cut off our Males, and uſe us with ſo many inhumanities as are unſufferable, unexpreſſible; Whereas if you come among us, you may make our yoke the heavier, and burdens the greater, may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get jealouſies concerning us, and ſo render us the more miſerable? — Theſe, and others, may be thought to have had weight in them. But herein now breaks forth the excellency of believing; <hi>By Faith</hi> he turns the deaf ear to all theſe clamours, is ſatisfied in his Choice on the other hand; and that not in an head-ſtrong, reſolute frollick, but as having the beſt and moſt convincing demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on his ſide; he choſe for the better, for grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter riches in hand, for a greater recompence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in hope. The other <hi>tender</hi> which he refuſed, he ſaw had more of an <hi>Hook</hi> than of an <hi>Help</hi> in it, was a <hi>ſnare</hi> rather than any <hi>advantage;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he utterly rejects it. At this Point is a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table tryal of the Truth, ſtrength, and excellency of a Believers <hi>Faith,</hi> when he is helped to ponder a Deliverance, an Accommodation, at the very brink of tryal and torture, and if he finds it too dear (as a man may buy Gold too dear) he there and then rejects it, and rather chuſeth the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing than the ſinning ſide. This leads us now, to the main <hi>Practical Queſtion</hi> in this day.</p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:40849:46"/>
                  <p>Queſt. <hi>How ſhall a Chriſtian know when his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance may be bought too dear, when he muſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace any Tortures, rather than touch with it, though it be tendered?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Unto this I ſhall endeavour to Anſwer in <hi>Five</hi> or <hi>Six</hi> Particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. When the greateſt <hi>Deliverance</hi> is tendered on the one hand, and the greateſt <hi>Tortures</hi> threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned on the other. If I cannot come at the <hi>good</hi> of that Deliverance, but I muſt commit ſome <hi>ſin</hi> in coming at it, I may not in that caſe touch with, but muſt refuſe that Deliverance. The Reaſon of this is manifeſt, There is more <hi>of evil</hi> in the leaſt ſin, than there can poſſibly be <hi>of good</hi> in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt deliverance. You have the caſe cleared in the Inſtance laſt given of <hi>Moſes,</hi> there was but one little word that turned the ſcale of his determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſo powerfully, and that was, <hi>they were the pleaſures of Sin for a ſeaſon.</hi> He could not accept of, and improve the accommodation of the Court any longer without ſin; he ſaw how ſin had inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed and incorporated its ſelf into them, and ſo they could be no longer urged but as temptations to, and coſtly coverings of ſin; and on this ſingle bottom he rejects them, and reckons the worſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches and ſufferings, where Chriſt may be had, and incomparably far better. <hi>One Sinner</hi> (and ſo one ſin) <hi>deſtroyeth much good;</hi> as a few <hi>dead Flies will much ſweet Oyntment,</hi> Eccleſ. 9.18. &amp; 10.1. It will not ſerve the turn to ſay as <hi>Lot</hi> did, <hi>Is it not a little one, and my ſoul ſhall live?</hi> The extenua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, leſſening, and excuſing ſin in ſuch caſes, is very frequent, but exceeding dangerous; and then is <hi>Job's</hi> charge eaſily incurred, <hi>Chap.</hi> 36.21. <hi>Take
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:40849:47"/> heed, regard not Iniquity, for this haſt thou choſen ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than Affliction.</hi> When great Affliction and (that which we call) a little Sin, come in competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in our choice, its uſual to chuſe Sin rather than Affliction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But it is uſually objected, <hi>Why is it not ſafe, of two evils to chuſe the leaſt?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> I Anſwer, This is very dangerous to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to practiſe, and utterly contrary to the mind of God, when the evil in the Queſtion is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout any Sin; for a man is not to commit the leaſt ſin, to avoid the greateſt ſuffering; no nor to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit one ſin to avoid another. For whereas many ſhelter themſelves under this refuge, which is not a reſt, becauſe it is defiled, they would do well to conſider, That there is no diſpenſation of God that neceſſitates any ſon of men alive to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any ſin whatſoever. God doth not need any ſin of ours to promote any end of his, nor any proper end of ours.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But if the Queſtion ariſeth, <hi>Did not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good men ſin, when they were driven to ſuch extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, to avoid ſufferings breaking in upon them? Did not</hi> Abraham, Jacob, David, <hi>and others, do ſo?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> I Anſwer, All this is moſt true: but mark it, when ever you find any of theſe recorded in the Word of God, they are there ſet as ſo many Sea-marks: As you ſee a <hi>Bouy</hi> upon the top of a Rock, to ſignifie that Death and danger are there, if you come neer that place; they are not as Land-marks which you are directed to approach unto, but as Dungeon-lights, from which you muſt keep the fartheſt diſtance, in dark and ſtormy nights. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:40849:47"/> you may obſerve, That uſually where-ever you find a Believer hath avoided a danger, or graſped at a priviledge in a way of ſin, uſually God hath made that a bitter priviledge to them by that time he hath done with them. As in the caſe of <hi>David,</hi> ſeeking his Satisfaction and Comforts in <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> which he attempts to come at in a way of Adultery and Blood; for beſide the breaking his communion with God, and the breaking his bones, the Sword never departs from his houſe. <hi>Jacob</hi> he lies and uſeth indirect courſes to come at the Birth-right of <hi>Eſau,</hi> and the Bleſſing of <hi>Iſaac:</hi> but obſerve him, all his dayes he walks in a very troubleſome pilgrimage, the reſt of the few and evil dayes he had to live; his gray hairs were brought with ſorrow to the Grave.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But it is ſometimes objected, <hi>The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon had in his eye and intention, the bringing about ſome good by it, ſome priviledge to ſerve God the quieter, and ſome liberty of enjoying what he hath, the better to do good to them that are neceſſitated, and may not that excuſe and plead for a little latitude, which ſome acts of his have?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> I Anſwer, as <hi>Job</hi> did his Friends, <hi>chap.</hi> 13.6, 7. <hi>Hear my reaſoning, and hearken to the pleadings of my lips. Wilt thou ſpeak wickedly for God? and talk deceitfully for him?</hi> This very way of reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you have ſtated and refuted by the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.7, 8. <hi>If the Truth of God hath abounded by my lye to his Glory, why yet am I judged as a ſinner?</hi> As though he had ſaid, If the Glory of God was brought about, or the Truth of God brought forth to evidence the more by a lye, or fault of mine, Doth not that acquit me from being a ſinner, and
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:40849:48"/> blame-worthy in ſo doing? His anſwer, is with the greateſt vehemency rejecting it, as a ſlanderous report, and that which was falſly faſtned either up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Doctrine or Practice, that a man may do evil that good may come thereby; God doth not require or accept any ſin of ours, to perform any ſervice, or promote any ends of his.</p>
                  <p n="2">2dly. A ſecond caſe in which the queſtion is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, when I may not accept Deliverance, is this, When I cannot come at the good of Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, but I muſt give a ſtab, ſtretch, or wound to a good Conſcience. I ought not upon ſuch terms to touch with Deliverance; for thus to do, were but to exchange and avoid the torture of my body, and admit in the room of it a torture upon my ſoul and ſpirit. They who will adventure to ruſh upon, and run down the counſel, comfort, and judgement that Conſcience ſets up, and would keep up in them, they little think what an hazard they run. <hi>Paul</hi> could ſtedfaſtly behold the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and tell the High-Prieſt (that was Preſident of it) that God would ſmite him as a whited-wall, when he had this defence to make, <hi>I have lived in all good Conſcience to this day,</hi> Acts 23.1, 2, 3. This makes Councils that perſecute, ſlight and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicable; torments, ſweet and eaſie. Though with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out there be fightings, yet inwardly there will be peace; whereas if our hearts condemn us, God is greater than our hearts, and knoweth all things. To have God and our own Conſciences againſt us at once, will not be countervailed by the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of this world, that any obtain by ſtretching a good Conſcience, making ſhipwrack of Faith and a good Conſcience. I have been ſometimes
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:40849:48"/> awakned with the dread of that word, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.11, 12. when a threatning is exhibited from the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, and then to have God give ſentence alſo againſt a People, that is dreadful; to have God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, our ſelves againſt us, and many to one, but we draw men againſt us too in ſuch caſes, this is the worſt of torments; whereas all is rendred eaſie when we can ſay, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17.2. <hi>Let my ſentence come forth from thy preſence.</hi> If God be for us, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience for us, who then can be againſt us? who can harm us? We may reade in <hi>Cain, Judas, Spira,</hi> and many others, how fearful it hath been to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo a wound in them: A man may ſuſtain his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of other kinds, <hi>but a wounded Conſcience who can bear?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> Its true, <hi>I cannot quiet the clamours of Conſcience as I would do, but I find I am very igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and men tell me, This I may do, and that I may do very ſafely, and I am bound to think of them bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than my ſelf, and not to prefer before their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the dictates of my weak Conſcience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is a very dangerous thing to do any thing againſt the dictates of an erring Conſcience, provided thou knoweſt not at preſent that it is in this thing erring. It is a queſtion among many, Whether the dictates of an erring Conſcience do bind? but ſure I am, that violence offer'd to an erring Conſcience, hath a direct tendency to ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie him that doth any thing with a doubting Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; <hi>He that doubteth is damned if he eat: for whatſoever is not of Faith is Sin,</hi> Rom. 14.23. <hi>Bleſſed is the man that condemneth not himſelf in the things that he alloweth.</hi> Though thy Conſcience may be erronious, yet while thou knoweſt it not to
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:40849:49"/> be ſo, it is the beſt friend thou haſt under Heaven. Take heed therefore by the force of others, or the fear and treachery that is in thy ſelf, thou admit any violence done to it, leſt once ſtretching it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond its ſtaple, it never do the offices of a good Conſcience more to thee, to counſel, excuſe, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs toward thy peace more.</p>
                  <p>Object. <hi>But I have ſeen other men accept of, comply with, and yield to, that which my Conſcience makes ſuch a noiſe about, and they good men too, and yet they profeſs they have peace in it; and why may not I adventure?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> For my part, I durſt not judge another mans Servant; to his own Maſter he ſtands or falls: Yet I have ſometimes obſerved men who have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventured in this kind, and though they have car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried it with an high forehead, and put a bold coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance on it; yet there are times when one may diſcern them to have pale faces, which may give intimation, all is not well within: ſuch are under great temptation to keep up their credit till the Lord arreſt them with a new Conviction, as he did <hi>David,</hi> with a <hi>Thou art the man!</hi> and then they may, as he, be forced to cry out (how long ſoever he had carried it ſtoutly) <hi>All my bones are out of joynt; Reſtore to me the joyes of thy Salvation, and take not away thy Holy Spirit from me.</hi> But ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe their Conſciences do not ſmite them, they may have a kind of peace that is but from ſecurity, not the peace of God, not the peace of the anſwer of a good Conſcience by the bloud of ſprinkling. The Apoſtle tells us of a Conſcience <hi>ſeared with a hot Iron,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.2. Some ſorts of violence done to Conſcience are left by the Lord to the Devils
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:40849:49"/> curing, who heals the ſmart of divers wounds by ſearing them; but the cure is never the more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireable for all that. Its with Conſcience as it is with Cloth, which ſometimes the Fuller ſtrains ſo much upon the Tenters, till he break the very ſtaple of it, and then its neither fire nor water will ſhrink it (whereas being ſtrained but in an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way, it would) but though it ſhrink not, you may be ſure it will have no ſtrength for ſervice. Take heed you offer not ſuch force to Conſcience, leſt you find it ſhort of ſerving you as it ſhould in time of need.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If I cannot come at the good of Deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, but I muſt betray or balk ſome Truth of God, intruſted with me as a part of my Teſtimony, I may not upon any terms touch with that Deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Every Truth of Chriſt, committed to the care and cuſtody of a Chriſtian is of more worth and value than all his Comforts and Accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions under the Sun. And he that yields or betrays any Truth thus depoſited, as a pledge to his truſt and care, for the procuring any liberty to himſelf, hath too hard a bargain of it. You have an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs direction, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.23. <hi>Buy the Truth and ſell it not.</hi> We are to buy it whatever it coſt, but not to barter it whatever it will yield. That was a choice Spirit deſcribed, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.8. <hi>We can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing againſt the Truth, but for the Truth.</hi> The Glory of God may be ſo deeply engaged and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barqued in one Truth, as all my external comforts may not be named in one day with it. It hath been an expreſſion very taking with me, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.9, 10. God hath his times wherein moſt eminently he is put upon it to vindicate his Truth; the queſtion is
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:40849:50"/> brought upon the ſtage and tryal of the world, who muſt either yield and ſay, <hi>It is truth;</hi> or elſe muſt endure the teſt of God's Evidences, who are his Saints: <hi>Ye are my Witneſſes ſaith the Lord,</hi> or his Son, called <hi>his Servant whom he hath choſen;</hi> who in the grand conteſt with all the powers of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs hath, by witneſſing his good confeſſion, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited that name, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.14. <hi>The Amen, the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and true Witneſs;</hi> a reſemblance and proportion to him, is every Chriſtian required to keep, in his being called forth to a witneſs-bearing to him. As God values every Truth of his at an high rate, eſpecially in the day that it is to be ſpoken for, ſo ſhould we. There are divers Truths that in moſt Ages are not controverted; theſe are not ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly the Truths under preſent conſideration, but ſuch as the deſign of the Adverſary is manifeſt to root out from being profeſſed under heaven, ſuch are <hi>the Word of Patience,</hi> which muſt be kept, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.10. <hi>the preſent Truth,</hi> which muſt be had in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance and eſtabliſhment, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.12.</p>
                  <p>Object. <hi>Why, is not every truth, a truth now, a preſent truth?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Though that which is truth at any time, abides truth at all times; yet, as hath been ſaid, thoſe truths in a moſt eminent manner are called <hi>preſent truths,</hi> which concern at preſent the vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Glory of God, and draw on the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent tryals of the day upon the Aſſertors of it. I note this the rather, becauſe in this ſhifting-day many that would be thought to be the Lord's Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, pleaſe themſelves with this, <hi>Bleſſed be God we hold to Fundamentals! What Fundamental Truths have we yielded, or denied?</hi> and think themſelves
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:40849:50"/> no way concerned to keep up a teſtimony for thoſe truths which they call Circumſtantial, ſuch as are not matters of Salvation, whether it be held or practiſed this way, or the other way. Alas! by ſuch diſtinctions and evaſions as theſe, men have let go almoſt their whole <hi>teſtimony</hi> about the Royal right of Chriſt, to ſet up Inſtitutions of Worſhip that are to be maintained in his Authority only. And I fear that ſuch who can ſo eaſily relinquiſh their teſtimony to preſent Truths under this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, <hi>They are not Fundamental Truths,</hi> it will be found that when thoſe Truths which they now call <hi>Fundamental,</hi> ſhall be brought (as they may ſpeedily be brought) to their tryal, and ſo become preſent Truths, there will other diſtinctions be found out, to avoid the offence of the Croſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them alſo. For an unconceiveable weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in ſticking cloſe to every Truth is unavoidably contracted, by yielding to the betraying of any Truth. Hence <hi>Paul would not give place by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, no not for an hour</hi> (when there was great contention) <hi>that the Truth of the Goſpel might be continued,</hi> Gal. 2.5. ſo <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. you ſee how eagerly he <hi>contended with</hi> Peter, which might have endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered the Peace of the Churches, meerly, <hi>becauſe he walked not uprightly according to the Truth of the Goſpel.</hi> That Point which that Epiſtle handleth being the preſent Truth, which was moſt aſſaulted and endangered to be loſt in that day, occaſions him to be ſo jealous of it, that he would and did run all manner of hazards, rather than betray it. Our caſe is the ſame now: many glorious Truths hath the Lord brought forth, aſſerted, cleared, and committed to his Saints and Churches to keep un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rebukeable
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:40849:51"/> till the appearing of Chriſt, eſpecially thoſe of his Dominion over his Saints, and others, theſe now being put upon a publick teſt upon the ſtage of the World, and we as Witneſſes <hi>Subpoenâ</hi> to give in Evidence to the truth and goodneſs of them, We durſt not accept of any overtures of Deliverance, or otherwayes, whereby our Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to them ſhould be balked.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. When I cannot come at the good of Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, but I muſt bind up my hands from being capable of doing God that ſervice in my generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which he requireth of me freely for the time to come; when theſe are the terms, Deliverance is too dear forme, and may not be accepted.—We are called unto Liberty, and withal required to <hi>ſtand faſt in the Liberty wherewith Chriſt hath made us free, and not to be entangled with any yoke of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,</hi> Gal. 5.1. <hi>Not to be the ſervants of men,</hi> 1 Cor. 7.23. For, <hi>if we ſeek to pleaſe them, we cannot be the ſervants of Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 1.10. Now that thing which would bind up my hands from being ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to Jeſus Chriſt when he calls for my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, my yielding thereunto, whatever it be, is a betraying of my Chriſtian Liberty, which Chriſt hath purchaſed for me with his blood. We are debtors unto Grace, and may not violate that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation, or yield to any thing that incapacitates us to diſcharge it, by any means, or on any terms. You reade frequently at what an high rate in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral conteſts <hi>Paul</hi> ſtands upon his <hi>Romane Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,</hi> he would not when in Priſon came out to the detriment or diſparagement of thoſe his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane liberties, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.37. And ſhall <hi>Paul</hi> think earthly priviledges to be ſuch as he would indure
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:40849:51"/> longer impriſonment, rather than baſely betray them; and ſhall we who are called to Goſpel-liberties, bought at ſo dear a rate beyond his, (<hi>Acts</hi> 22.28. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18.) ſell them for a ſong, God forbid. You know when <hi>Moſes</hi> was upon the Treaty with <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> about the enlargement of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> divers overtures <hi>Pharaoh</hi> makes, according as the hand of the Lord preſſed on him. They ſhould ſacrifice in the Land, <hi>Exod.</hi> 8.26. or, they ſhould go out, ſo none but the Men might go, leaving the Women and Children, <hi>chap.</hi> 10.9, 10, 11. or, They ſhould all go, but they ſhould leave the Flocks and Herds, <hi>chap.</hi> 10.24. But what is the reſolution of <hi>Moſes? There ſhall not an hoof be left behind, for thereof muſt we take to ſerve the Lord our God: and we know not with what we muſt ſerve the Lord until we come thither,</hi> v. 26. Shall <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſtand on their Points to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure Bondage rather than leave an Hoof behind? And ſhall we make ſuch terms to have Locks and Fetters upon our Hands and Feet from ſerving Chriſt for time to come, ſeeing we little know what he may require of us to ſerve him withal? God forbid. Can true <hi>Iſraelites</hi> endure to have Deliverance upon ſuch terms, as the thruſting out their right eyes, and laying it for a reproach on all <hi>Iſrael?</hi> Would not all the Lords people lift up their voices and weep if it ſhould be ſo? 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11.2, 4.</p>
                  <p>Object. <hi>What would you have me do? I am now (perhaps) a Priſoner. They will give me liberty ſo I will engage to Preach no more, to Meet no more, &amp;c. If they keep me a Priſoner, I cannot Meet, or Preach,

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This way of reaſoning is very enſna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring; for, (firſt) if thou art in bonds, thy great intereſt lies in this, in <hi>giving diligence that the Word of God is not bound,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.9. but rather as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.12. That the things that fall out of this kind, <hi>fall out rather to the furtherance of the Goſpel.</hi> Such therefore as ſeek and get freedom on terms that leave the Word obſtructed in that free paſſage wherein it ſhould run and be glorified, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.1. they do but get the <hi>fetters</hi> off from their own feet, and ſet them upon the Word of God, which is but Deliverance with a miſchief. (2) Thy liberty obtained in ſuch a way, and on ſuch reaſonings, is but a liberty and freedom to ſerve thy ſelf, feed and ſatisfie thy ſelf and luſts as a man, not to ſerve Chriſt, or do any thing for thy God as a Chriſtian man. (3) If thou art violently reſtrained by them, the ſin of any omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Duty and Service, lies at their door; and to their peril be it when the King ſhall demand the reaſon of thy want of ſervice: but when thou ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepteſt of thoſe terms, thou becameſt acceſſary with them, art in conjunction with them, its thy ſin as much, if not more than theirs; <hi>they think they do God good ſervice.</hi> (4) If thou art only bound by the hands of Violence, the Lord looks on thee, and reckons thee as his free man, free in Spirit, thou reſerveſt the dominion of that for God. Thou liveſt not, dyeſt not as a Fool dieth, but as a man falleth before wicked men, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.33, 34.</p>

                  <p>Object. <hi>Now there is little opportunity to do the Lord any ſuch ſervice, but if ever an opportunity pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, I hope to be as ready as another: may not ſuch obligations be enervated, repented of, and a ſoul diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obliged from them?</hi>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It hath been, and is ſtill the crying ſin of this day, and of the years paſt, That perſons have thought it a very ſmall matter, to make and break theſe kind of Engagements, according as intereſt preſents them with an opportunity; the iniquity and provocation whereof I ſhall only attempt to open in one Scripture, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 17.12, 13, to <hi>verſ.</hi> 20. where God expoſtulates the caſe with the rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Houſe of <hi>Judah.</hi> They and the King of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> make a Covenant, and there is for ratification of it the Oath of God added: The King of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons</hi> deſign was to make the Kingdom baſe, that it might not lift up its ſelf; and in this exigency they make a Covenant. The queſtion is put, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their taking an opportunity to ſhake off this yoke and break this Covenant, might not be ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded with proſperity? This conſequence the Lord diſclaims with the higheſt indignation, and that, <hi>becauſe of the Oath of God,</hi> the quarrel and controverſie of that Oath and Covenant ſhould be required ſeverely at the hands of ſuch a treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous people. — If thy hand have been lifted up in Truth, Righteouſneſs, and Judgement already, then take care how thou retract that, and to whom thou lift it up the ſecond time, leſt it prove a double provocation.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. If I cannot come at the good of Deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, but I muſt intrench upon the Name, Honour, and Glory of God, which he hath lifted up in the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:40849:53"/> World, I may not touch with that Deliverance. There are ſome wayes and works of God wherein he hath more immediately and eminently in ſome generations, concerned his Name than in others, or than ever it was before. God went to make him a Name of Greatneſs and Terribleneſs, by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and driving the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions out of <hi>Canaan,</hi> 1 Chron. 17.21.

                     </gap> by bringing <hi>Judah</hi> out of <hi>Babylon;</hi> and will do, by bringing his <hi>Sion</hi> from under <hi>Antichriſt.</hi> To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the later whereof, he hath made very glorious advances in our dayes, and we have ſung his praiſe in them, ſo as it may be ſaid of his Holy People at this day, as of <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.32, 33, 34. <hi>And all this he hath done to get himſelf a glorious Name:</hi> Our zeal for which, and love to which, is now brought to tryal, whether we will yea or nay, deny his Name? A faithful adhering to which, though by a people that have but little ſtrength, is very acceptable to the Lord, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.8, 9, 10. And he will do great things for ſuch in times and hours of temptation. If therefore God be at this day ſo tender of his Name, as he is, that he will not give his glory to another, we ought to be upon his ſide in this deſign; and eſpecially when this Name of his comes to be ſpoken about, all our Deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances ought to be brought to this teſt, if they may be had with a ſaving to this Name they are welcome, otherwayes they may not be accepted.</p>
                  <p>Object. <hi>But whatſoever we can ſay was done in our dayes of that kind, the Lord now appears plucking it down again, leads that ſtrength into captivity, &amp; gives that glory into the enemies hand, beſtowes the marks of favour upon the other party, who thrive and proſper;
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:40849:53"/> and being advanced to the capacity we ſee them, we do but follow Providence in joyning there?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The beſt of thy plea is, God is angry with his People, &amp; hath a great Controverſie with them, which he pleads with deep and bitter ſtrokes, and thou wilt be on his ſide, angry with them too, and plead againſt them. In ſo doing thou mayeſt be right and ſafe; but I muſt tell thee thou haſt very much reaſon to take heed both of thy ſtanding, and frame of ſpirit, leſt his indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation take place on thee for being out of thy place; the Lord is very jealous againſt ſuch as offer their ſervice to be the executioners of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes upon his heritage, <hi>Zech.</hi> 1.15. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.26. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 47.6. that was a ſore word, <hi>Obadiah</hi> verſ. 11. <hi>For thy violence againſt thy Brother, ſhame ſhall cover thee, in the day that thou ſtoodeſt on the Other ſide — thou ſhouldeſt not have looked on the day of thy Brother, &amp;c.</hi> The Lord takes ſpecial notice on what ſide men ſtand, when he is dealing with his own Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren for their folly. (2) Moreover the Lord's rebuke is not againſt his People for their Principle and teſtimony, but for their unſutableneſs to that Teſtimony and Principle of theirs which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed. And now he is come in the way of this tryal to ſee whether we will cleave to him with our whole heart, and with our whole ſoul; what rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant they be who will cleave to him in principles of Righteouſneſs, of Holineſs, of Purity, of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, of Goſpel-worſhip, of an Heavenly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, and underneath the feet of theſe ſubject their intereſt of Eaſe, Reſt, Liberty, Eſtates, Limbs, Lives; his Voice is therefore now, in this reſpect, who is upon the Lord's ſide? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94.16.
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:40849:54"/> Here its an exceeding mercy indeed to have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained mercy to be faithful; not to deny his Name whatever it coſts.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Deliverance is then to be dreaded, not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, when I cannot come at the good of Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, without giving juſt occaſion of ſtumbling to many <hi>to fall,</hi> and of grief and affliction to the bonds of many <hi>that ſtand.</hi> Precious in the ſight of the Lord are the lives and ſouls of the pooreſt Saints, and ought to be tender to us, that we do nothing whereby they be ſtumbled, offended, or made weak, much leſs deſtroyed for whom Chriſt died. <hi>Aſaphs</hi> firſt conviction of his extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.15. was, if he ſhould ſpeak thus, he ſhould offend againſt the generation of Gods Children.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But ſay ſome, <hi>The different tempers and diſtempers of people and of profeſſors is become ſuch, that there is no walking by this rule, in this caſe; for there are divers Saints will come and tell me, if I do ſuch or ſuch a thing, I ſhall ſin and wound them, encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage others to follow me to their hurt,</hi> Others (no way
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:40849:54"/> inferiour to the former in Wiſdom, Parts, Piety) tell me, <hi>If I do not ſuch a thing, I ruine my family, am worſe than an Infidel, run them as well as my ſelf upon danger, and temptations, ſo that in my omiſſion and refuſal, I ſhall grieve and offend them, and what may I do in this caſe, when I am likely to offend Saints either way?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> When this is really ſo, it is a ſtrait caſe, though I think ſomewhat rare in all the ſtraitning circumſtances in the Objection: but put the caſe it be ſo; this is a ruled caſe with me, If I can bring the matter into this plain evidence, that in my do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, I ſhall really endanger the one party to ſin; and in my not doing it, I ſhall but endanger the other party to ſuffer: being neceſſitated to a choice, I am to take that courſe whereby I may prevent the ones ſinning, though I cannot prevent but really endanger the others ſuffering. For as I may not commit any ſin my ſelf to prevent my own ſuffering, ſo I may not run any one upon ſin, to prevent another from ſuffering; for betwixt ſin and ſuffering there is no compariſon. Indeed I may not chuſe any ſin or ſuffering in my ſelf, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, if it may righteouſly be avoided; but when I am driven to this <hi>Dilemma,</hi> though it be an hard yet it is a clear caſe what I am to do, and caſt the care of the iſſue upon the Lord. We have a very high inſtance of this in the caſe of <hi>Haman</hi> and <hi>Mordecai,</hi> Eſth. 3. throughout. You have <hi>Haman</hi> advanced by the King to exceeding dignity, and a Royal Commandment, that all ſhould bow and do him reverence; a ſmall matter, juſt, and requiſite (one would think) for <hi>Mordecai,</hi> to have done as well as others, rather than break the Kings Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,

What would have been ſaid of him now (think you) to have run ſo many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, both Eſtates and Lives, upon immediate hazard, rather than to yield a Civil token of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to ſuch a Magiſtrate? What can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to juſtifie him? Why, his Juſtification lies in the due conſideration of the two denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations theſe two men have, in the <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>fourth verſes.</hi> What was <hi>Mordecai?</hi> why he was a Jew; and he told them that enquired about the reaſons of his contempt, <hi>That he was a Jew. verſ.</hi> 4. a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of no mean Quality, Pedigree, and Accompt; ſee <hi>Eſth.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Ezra.</hi> 2.2. <hi>Neh.</hi> 7.7. And what was <hi>Haman?</hi> Why (<hi>verſ.</hi> 1.) he was the Son of <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datha</hi> the Agagite. What was <hi>Agag</hi> (whence <hi>Haman</hi> deſcended) He was the King of <hi>Amalek,</hi> the relict of that deſtruction about which God had not only expreſly determined, <hi>Exod.</hi> 17.14, 16. <hi>Numb.</hi> 24.20. <hi>Deut.</hi> 25.17, 18, 19. but given a very ſtrict charge to <hi>Saul</hi> to make utter rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of him from under Heaven, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.2, 3. Now as this indiſpenſible Commandment lay for the deſtruction of <hi>Amalek</hi> in general, and ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation was provoked for ſparing <hi>Agag</hi> in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular in that Chapter: So had the Lord expreſly determined, <hi>Numb.</hi> 24.7. <hi>His King ſhould be high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than</hi> Agag, <hi>and his Kingdom ſhould be advanced.</hi> This Controverſie was to ſtand unreconcileable from generation to generation (<hi>Exod.</hi> 17.16.) nay, when <hi>Iſrael</hi> was at the loweſt, and the branch of
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:40849:55"/> 
                     <hi>David</hi> as a root out of a dry ground, as it was in that day (they being in Captivity) yet was there preſerved a Root againſt <hi>Amalek,</hi> according to <hi>Judg.</hi> 5.14. This wicked <hi>Haman</hi> was the <hi>Jews</hi> ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, <hi>Eſth.</hi> 3.10. <hi>&amp;</hi> 7.6. the wretched root of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity abode in him, that he derived from the ſtock of <hi>Amalek.</hi> Unto him in this character, ſpirit, and capacity, faithful <hi>Mordecai</hi> cannot bow, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members the Lords Controverſie, Prophecy, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences formerly againſt <hi>Amalek,</hi> and hence he cannot bow or yield in the leaſt, whatever it coſt; the iſſue, as well as the intereſt of this Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, was not unknown to his Wiſe-men and Wife, before the final deciſion of it, <hi>Chap.</hi> 6.13. <hi>If</hi> Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decai <hi>be of the Seed of the</hi> Jews, <hi>before whom thou haſt begun to fall, thou ſhalt not prevail againſt him, but ſhalt ſurely fall before him.</hi> Mark, here is an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt againſt which God had a ſtated Controverſie, yet in one of the Branches of its Royal-line in a Riſing way, the not bowing and yielding to which, is the high-way to endanger preſently the Lives and Eſtates of all the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God: yet, being <hi>Mordecai</hi> hath that foundation to ſtand upon, and is as the Lord's Root againſt <hi>Amalek,</hi> its ſafer (he judgeth) to adventure the loſing all that could be loſt, in a way of ſuffering, both his own and others, than betray the Lord's Intereſt; cloſe up thus the Lord's Controverſie, ſtep aſide from the Lord's Precepts, and make invalid the Lord's Promiſes; and by his publick example, encourage and involve others in the like iniquities. The Conſequences of this faithful abiding with God, is well known: The accommodating it, is left to ſerious conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. This Point in hand ſtands clearly witneſſed
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:40849:56"/> to in it: When the ſufferings only of Saints lye endangered if I take one way, and their ſinning be endangered if I take the other; I am to reſiſt to blood, ſtriving againſt ſin, much more to bonds, or any other tortures or ſufferings. I do not deny but the caſe above, had many extraordinary cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances clothing it, but yet many excellent noble leſſons may be ſafely deduced.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall, from the whole of what hath been deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered under this head of Doctrine, draw a few <hi>Inferences,</hi> and proceed.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If in ſo many caſes Saints are not to accept Deliverance, but its the intereſt and excellency of their Faith rather to endure tortures: Then I beſeech you to be very tender how you judge o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, for that upon tryals they do not accept of Deliverance, on ſuch terms as may ſeem very plain and eaſie unto you. Its the ordinary cenſure of ſome, <hi>This is but their humour, and ſelf-willedneſs, becauſe they would ſeem to be ſomething, &amp;c.</hi> I ſay, though you cannot make a judgment upon what bottom ſuch a Chriſtian ſtands in not accepting Deliverance, yet do not preſently conclude againſt him; it may be he hath more reaſon to refuſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance than it is ſafe for him to expreſs unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, in an age when men are <hi>made offenders</hi> and deſtroyed <hi>for a word;</hi> leave him to the Lord, and charitably ſuppoſe he hath a Conſcience to God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in what he doth; and though it be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guided in this matter, yet its the beſt he hath, and he is bound to make much of it; <hi>Do not judge another man's Servant, to his own Maſter he ſtands or falls.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="93" facs="tcp:40849:56"/>2. I would upon the Promiſes further beſeech you, That ſince there are ſo many caſes in which its dangerous (however it may ſeem pleaſant) to accept Deliverance, you would give diligence that when theſe ſoul-ſhaking tryals are ready to beſet you, and ſet upon you, you may not be taken in a way of ſurprize: the greateſt miſchief Satan doth to ſouls in this kind is, when he frights them into Deliverance, and eſcape, ere ever their ſpirits are recovered to a juſt capacity to weigh and make a ſolid judgment what is beſt to be done in the caſe, all things conſidered. They are ready to be taken with that way of reaſoning that <hi>Eſau</hi> was, <hi>Gen.</hi> 25.32. <hi>Behold, I am at the point to die; and what profit ſhall this Birth-right do to me?</hi> So they: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold! I am at the point to be impriſoned, to be baniſhed, to be tortured: and what good then can this Profeſſion do to me? And ſo being ſurprized with the fright, ſell their Birth-right for a little meat, or ſomething like it which periſheth with the uſing of it. In order to the preventing which miſchief, I beſeech you Conſider:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Firſt, That this Tryal whereupon the Lord brings you, perhaps is the principal, if not the only opportunity in which you may ever have the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to ſpeak a word on Gods behalf, and bear thus witneſs for him as long as you live; <hi>What ſhall we do for our Siſter in the day that ſhe is ſpoken for?</hi> was a ſeaſonable queſtion, <hi>Cant.</hi> 8.8. There is a day when God is to be ſpoken for, Chriſt to be ſpoken for, Truth to be ſpoken for, which being elapſed, the things of this our peace may be hid from our eyes. Oh! therefore, while you have this opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, omit not to do good, to improve it to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="94" facs="tcp:40849:57"/>2dly. Conſider, A little ground loſt, at ſuch a Seaſon, and in ſuch a Teſtimony, is hardly reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered again; where you find one Chriſtian ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recovers it, you may obſerve abundance decline and grow weak in making any future reſiſtance to temptations. We are called to follow the Lord as Virgins: now where the enemy hath prevailed once to violate the chaſtity of ſuch, to bruiſe the teats of their virginity, they afterward grow weak to make oppoſition to attempts of the like nature, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.30. <hi>How weak is thy heart, ſeeing thou doeſt all theſe things, the work of an imperious whoriſh woman?</hi> A back-ſliding Profeſſor is like a whoriſh woman, who having loſt her chaſtity, though ſhe gets an imperious forehead, yet hath a weak heart; though ſhe is bold to aſſert her chaſtity, yet ſhe is weak to preſerve it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3dly. Conſider, How eaſie and frequent it is with the Lord to make that deliverance which you buy ſo dear, become a real burden to you. How many wayes hath he to make your liberty a burden, by freſh vexations ſuch meet withal, your Trade (for the ſake of which you adventure ſuch ſtrange at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts) a real burden, by Loſſes, Deadneſs, Croſſes in it? Your very Lives a burden, by ſickneſs, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other vanities and vexations of ſpirit? And who would buy that too dear, that is lyable to ſo many cauſualties? Take heed that Satan doth not at ſuch ſurprizals make a market upon you; for you are not ignorant of his enterprizes.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But leaving this Point, let us proceed to the Third Head, or manner of our conſidering Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, and that is, as Deliverance ſtands com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with, and undervalued by the preference of a
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:40849:57"/> better Reſurrection, when the Torturers tender of Deliverence, and the Comforters tender of a better Reſurrection come in competition: though both are good in themſelves, yet Faith helps to make the choice of the Reſurrection, as being the better incomparably, notwithſtanding any incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies on this ſide it.</p>
                  <p>Hence the Third Suppoſition in the general Doctrine is, ☞ <hi>That a Believing Proſpect into the Reſurrection, is of mighty force to carry a Chriſtian through any Tortures, and to reject any unworthy ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Deliverance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Faith</hi> tranſmitting the eye upon Eternity, and fixing the expectation thereupon the conſequences of the bleſſed coming of the King, ſets all at rights, turns the Scales toward the advantage of the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Intereſt of God, as worthy to be adhered to: in compariſon of which Reſurrection, Torments are but a flea-biting, and Tenders of Deliverance as a painted feather. The Emphaſis lies in the term <hi>[Better.]</hi> Faith ſatisfies, that the ſoul in this hath choſen the <hi>better part,</hi> not only better than Suffering, for ſo may Deliverance ſeem to be: But Better upon all accompts whatſoever, than the beſt and faireſt offer, that can poſſibly be made to defloure, and intice from following after God. Earth may be good, Deliverance unto it, and the Accommodations in it, may be good; but when they are at the beſt, Chriſt is better, Heaven is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: to have Chriſt with us in Sufferings, with Peace, Joy and Satisfaction here; and to be ever with Chriſt in the Reſurrection of the Juſt, this is tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendently beſt of all. The clearing this Point would be attempted (did not time prevent) in
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:40849:58"/> conſidering particularly, theſe Three things:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Deliverance at the beſt, with its power to allure us unto the choice of it [for its not it, when we are under offence at it, but Deliverance with its full allowance, that is brought undervalue in this choice.]</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Reſurrection conſidered at the worſt, and as it lay obvious to Objections (eſpecially to them in that day) yet forcible and effectual to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The actings and excellency of Faith, in ſingling out, and fixing the ſouls choice herein, notwithſtanding the abſence of any other Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings or Arguments to turn the Scale, other than theſe drawn ſingly from the Concerns of this Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>
                  <p>Theſe can be but briefly touched at preſent, as for the former, thus; —</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Deliverance here offered (as was ſhewed before) is Deliverance with all its Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Accommodations, that we can imagine to ſet it off admirable, and apt to take with a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured, tempted, poor Creature; (I mean in an humane dreſs) all that the Adverſary is capable of adding to it, to give it a gloſs, that may effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally anſwer his ends. Now there are Two things which do tend much this way, and are apt to be very taking to a ſenſual or watchleſs eye. (1) The <hi>Pleaſantneſs.</hi> (2) The <hi>Preſentneſs</hi> of Deliverance, as I may expreſs it.</p>
                  <p n="1">(1) Its one main part of the Tempters buſineſs to ſet off, as he can, the taking <hi>Pleaſantneſs</hi> of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance; he baited his Hook <hi>to Christ</hi> with all the Kingdoms of the World and the glory of them,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:40849:58"/> and that in a moment of time, with this offer, <hi>All this Power will I give thee, and the Glory of them, Luke</hi> 4.5, 6. To <hi>Aſaph,</hi> with a condition of men that have no bands in death, their ſtrength firm, are not in trouble as other men, nor plagued as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men; eyes ſtanding out with fatneſs, they have more than heart could wiſh. — Therefore God's People often turn in hither, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. <hi>beginning.</hi> The firſt <hi>temptation</hi> was by a Tree good for food, pleaſant to the eye, and to be deſired to make one wiſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.6. He never wants high and fair pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to make up a <hi>temptation</hi> effectual to allure: You ſhall buy and ſell, be free of the great City, that made rich all her Merchants (<hi>Rev.</hi> 18.10, to 19.) ſo you will receive the mark in the forehead, or right hand; you may admit it ſecretly, if you will not openly, <hi>chap.</hi> 13.16, 17.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2) The Tempter alſo inſiſts much, and gains much advantage by repreſenting and impoſing the <hi>Preſentneſs</hi> of Deliverance; you ſhall have this preſently. The Reſurrection you ſpeak of, is a great way off, a long time to come; and will you tarry till the Heavens be no more for ſuch a thing, and in mean time overlook that Deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance which is in hand? <hi>A Bird in Hand is worth two in the Wood. Better is the ſight of the eyes, than the wandring of the deſire,</hi> Eccleſ. 6.9. This offer of things that are ſeen, hath great prevalency with a ſoul who lives more by Sence than by Faith; this was the ſnare of <hi>Demas,</hi> he forſook that way of the Lord, having loved the <hi>preſent</hi> world, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10. To be delivered from the <hi>preſent world, (Gal.</hi> 1.4.) is an extraordinary ſalvation, it being ſo apt to take with us when we begin to grow weary, and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:40849:59"/> can wait on the Lord no longer; and reckon (as was noted of <hi>Eſau) I am at the point of Death, and what good can this Birth-right</hi> (this hope of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, and another World to come) <hi>do to me?</hi> Give me Deliverance, will ſuch a one ſay, or I die. Thus the Captive Exile haſteth, leſt he die in the Pit, and his bread ſhould fail. —</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> But conſider we the Reſurrection; and here if we will improve the thoughts of it to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, we ſhould admit to our thoughts about it thoſe Objections that may make it ſeem leſs ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king; there are Three of them that we may eaſily conjecture might rationally ariſe in the ſpirits of theſe poor tempted tortured ones, againſt their adhering to the Reſurrection in the neglect of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Deliverance.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. About the very truth of this Notion of the Reſurrection, there is the appearance of a very great impoſſibility, Fleſh and Blood, Sence and Reaſon object, <hi>How can theſe things be? If a man die can he live again? Of all living there is hope; a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Dog is better than a dead Lyon; the living know that they ſhall die, but the dead know nothing at all, Eccleſ.</hi> 9.4, 5.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the Reaſonings of a rational mind that admits only of humane demonſtration. When <hi>Paul</hi> was making his Defence before <hi>Agrippa,</hi> one who was expert in all Cuſtoms and Queſtions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Jews,</hi> yet reaſons on this Suppoſition, That it was thought a thing incredible with them that God ſhould raiſe the dead, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.8. with <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. If the queſtion be put, <hi>Can theſe dry bones live?</hi> Senſe, Reaſon, Learning, hath no better than
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:40849:59"/> this aſtoniſhed anſwer, <hi>Lord, thou knowest,</hi> Ezek. 37.3. This now is a great diſadvantage unto a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional choice, as our caſe is. But here ſteps in <hi>Faith,</hi> which acts upon dead things, a dead Womb in <hi>Sarah,</hi> dead Loins in <hi>Abraham,</hi> a Sacrificed <hi>Iſaac,</hi> a Crucified <hi>Christ,</hi> the ſlaughtered <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> a betrayed <hi>Cauſe,</hi> are ſubjects proper to a living <hi>Faith</hi> to exerciſe its ſelf upon, when it hath a word of Promiſe; <hi>Faith</hi> thinks it not incredible that God ſhould raiſe the dead; it lives upon that great Power that raiſed <hi>Jeſus</hi> from the dead: So that though the bones be ſcattered about the Graves mouth, as when one cutteth and cleaveth Wood, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 141.7. though the bodies of the Saints are given to be meat to the Fowls of the Heaven, and their fleſh to the Beaſts of the Earth, their Blood ſhed like water, and there be none to bury them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 79.2, 3. though Limb be torn from Limb, and Quarter ſet at the greateſt diſtance from Quarter; though the fire devours the Bowels, and the Dogs lick the Blood, yet <hi>Faith</hi> is not hereby loſt in a certainty of Concluſion; This is Duſt in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> &amp; <hi>Jacob;</hi> and though it be dead to us, yet all live to him, <hi>Luke</hi> 20.37, 38.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If there ſhould be a yielding to the poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it, yet it might be objected, The demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Point, and its determination in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-evidence, was not apparent and manifeſt in that day; Life and Immortality being reſerved to be brought to light through the Goſpel, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10. and the way into the Holieſt of all, being not yet made manifeſt, while as the firſt Tabernacle was yet ſtanding, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.8. Not but that there
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:40849:60"/> was a ſufficient Teſtimony in the Scriptures of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets to this Truth, to guide Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in the Hope of Glory; but ſo far was there a Vail on this, as well as other Truths, that the <hi>Sadduces,</hi> a Sect of no mean Repute and Authority in the <hi>Jewiſh Church,</hi> not only queſtioned, but ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly denyed any ſuch thing to be founded in the Old Teſtament at all, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.23. <hi>Acts</hi> 23.8. Nay, under the clear manifectations of this Truth in the Teſtimony of Chriſt and the Apoſtles in the New Teſtament, you ſee a generation who affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That <hi>the Reſurrection is paſt already, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw the Faith of ſome;</hi> againſt whom the Apoſtle diſputes at large, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. Nay, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all this, we ſee in all Ages there have been ſome, who by weakning the Authority of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in geneeal, or by a lawleſs, wanton allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizing the Scriptures that refer to this and other precious Truths in particular, do ſatisfie their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in rejecting the truth of the Lord's Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony herein. If it may be ſuppoſed that theſe ſouls, of whom the Text makes report, ſhould be aſſaulted with any part of this <hi>temptation,</hi> about the obſcurity of the revelation of this Doctrine in the Scriptures, it muſt needs magnifie the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of their Faith, that conquered this diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and through this cloud alſo conclude, the preferency of the Reſurrection to their tendered Deliverance.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But ſuppoſing the poſſibility and probability of this Doctrine be acknowledged to have been undoubted to them, yet this might remain a very conſiderable <hi>remora</hi> in their way; it was a thing a great while to come; many thouſand years have
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:40849:60"/> paſſed ſince the aſſertion of it, and yet no appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of it; and many thouſand years may yet be ere it take place; as was their reaſoning, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 12.27. and as the Scoffers of the laſt dayes object, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.4 Now (as was ſaid) when againſt this is objected, the <hi>Preſentneſs</hi> of the Worlds offer, you ſhall have Deliverance preſently, Liberty preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Eaſe preſently; and will you tarry till Doomſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day for a Reſurrection? The conqueſt of this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection muſt needs beſpeak the great power of Faith in the preſent choice.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Now conſider we the actings of Faith, in its interpoſition to turn the ſcale upon the ſingle proffer of the Reſurrection, and for the ſake of it to ſlight the terror; nay, to imbrace the ſentence of a Gibbet, a Stake, a Rack, an Ax, an Halter, a Tranſportation into Exile; ſurely we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude a man hath need deal upon notable prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples that is thus furniſhed. Now <hi>Faith</hi> helps by being the evidence of things that are not ſeen, as,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By annihilating, and rendring very empty and vain all thoſe things that can be offered in competition with the Reſurrection.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By realizing, and rendering very ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial and precious, all thoſe things that are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed in, and accompany the Reſurrection. Briefly thus; —</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> A diſcovery is made by believing, of the invalidity to an Heavenly mind, and its divine reaſonings of all that can poſſibly be offered by the Tempter, or his Torturers to debauch: Conſider them either (1) in their ſingle nature as they all are ſubjected through the fall to vanity. How
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:40849:61"/> many have this Deliverance, and are curſed with it, croſt with it, blaſted in it, unable to keep it, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> comfort themſelves under it? Take Deliverance alone, and what is it? <hi>A Cruſt for a Dog</hi> (ſaith <hi>Luther</hi> of the Turkiſh Empire) a feaſt too empty to ſatisfie an immortal ſoul. Wilt thou ſet thy eyes on that which is not? The whole Book of <hi>Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtes</hi> practically opened, is the effect of believing in a gracious heart, <hi>Vanity of Vanities</hi> (ſaith the Preacher, and ſo ſaith the Believer) <hi>Vanity of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, all is vanity.</hi> (2) Conſider we them in conjunction with the ſin that buys them, by means whereof they receive the denomination of the pleaſures of ſin. And then whereas in the former reſpect they were at beſt <hi>but vanity,</hi> in this they are <hi>vexation of ſpirit, an evil ſickneſs;</hi> wherein many thruſt themſelves through with many ſorrows, drown themſelves in ruine and perdition; and in this ſence to be avoided and fled from as from a Serpent. (3) Conſider we them in their compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition with Jeſus Chriſt, and as frequently they ſtand in oppoſition to him, and then they are very pernitious, muſt be hated, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.26. elſe we cannot be his Diſciples.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Faith makes a diſcovery of the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruction, and gives ſatisfactory evidence about it, as that which hath weight to bear down all contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry objections; the way it takes is not to fill the imagination with ſpeculatory Notions, but to put it out of doubt, and quiet it in receiving the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony God hath given by his Son therein: And particularly (1) it gives evidence of a very full and ſatisfactory repairation of all thoſe breaches that all theſe tortures and ſufferings could make
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:40849:61"/> upon their concerns therein. <hi>They,</hi> mentioned <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.34. <hi>took joyfully the ſpoiling of their Goods, knowing in themſelves they have in Heaven a better and an induring ſubſtance.</hi> Whatever Loſſes they ſuſtained in Stock or otherwiſe, it interrupted not their joy, they took it joyfully, the Reſurrection will pay for all. The like is true of the marks of the Lord Jeſus they now bear about in their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; now indeed they are the badges of loſs and infamy, but he accounts it is better to enter into Life blind and maimed, than to adventure Hell by ſaving them. At the Reſurrection of the Juſt, our vile bodies ſhall be made like unto the glorious body of our Lord. In point of the perfection of them, we know not what we ſhall be; only this we know, <hi>That when he appeareth we ſhall be like him, for we ſhall ſee him as he is.</hi> (2) As it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denceth a repair of loſſes thus ſuſtained; ſo it aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaineth a moſt abundant recompence, not of Debt but of Grace, when they that ſuffer with him ſhall receive the Crown of Life; for ſhame they ſhall receive double, and for confuſion they ſhall rejoyce in their portion. When this ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, <hi>Ye are they who have continued with me in my Temptations, and I appoint unto you a Kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto me,</hi> Luk. 22.28, 29. When for whatever hath been loſt or forſaken of his kind, there ſhall not only be made good the lundred-fold-promiſed, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.29. in Peace, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>oy, and Conſolation in Tribulation, but in that World to come Life everlaſting.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall draw the whole to a Concluſion in theſe Two or Three Inferences of Duty.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If all this (and a great deal more that might
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:40849:62"/> be ſaid) hold true, touching the worth as well as the truth of the Reſurrection; Then would I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, that you do not ſell the Doctrine of it for a Song; do not be ſo eaſily baffled as many be out of the Faith and expectation of it, by a few Allegorical Notions, and plauſible evaſions of thoſe Scripture-Teſtimonies that give evidence to this Truth, in which is wrapt up ſo much of your ſtanding Conſolation when ever you are called by any manner of death to put off your Tabernacle, that your fleſh alſo ſhall reſt in Hope, and your vile body be changed into the likeneſs of Chriſt's glorious body: Whatever natural corruption, weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, diſhonour it be ſown in, yet it ſhall be raiſed ſpiritual, in incorruption, power, glory, and be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver with the Lord.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Be intreated to give your ſelves more unto a ſearch and ſtudy of that bleſſed truth that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns your Reſurrection, and the glory that ſhall follow; and be not ye eaſily ſtartled and offended at it by reaſon of the miſcarriages of ſome who have been Aſſertours of it, and been too forward to vent their raſh Conceptions touching divers things about it. You know the bleſſedneſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced on them who reade and hear the things contained in that Book, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> moſt profeſſedly opens the Myſteries thereof, &amp; yielded in the Viſion and and Revelation of it, ſuch ſtanding Conſolation unto <hi>John,</hi> to whom it was made known; and is a Doctrine of unſpeakable ſtrength and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Lord's ſuffering, baniſhed, tortured ones, as many in this day have found it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Draw forth the Improvement of your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged conceptions and expectations of that
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:40849:62"/> day, in a way of Conſolation, rejoycing in Hope, and preſſing after the Light, Faith, Spirit, and Power of it, making ſure of your right to, and proper qualifications for that day. <hi>Bleſſed and Holy are they that have a part in this firſt Reſurrection;</hi> eſpecially improve it (as I ſaid) to Conſolation in all the loſſes you have ſuſtained, or are like to. This may ſeem one (amongſt others) to you, that a poor worm that ſpeaks, is to part (at preſent) with you, and it may be may ſee your face in the fleſh no more; doth this ſeem any way grievous? why, let us carry the caſe in our thoughts beyond the Grave, in a path of faithfulneſs; the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will bring us together again, and make amends for all the loſs herein ſuſtained: Then we ſhall be ever with the Lord in that triumph, of which the ſtranger cannot intermeddle with the Joy. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort one another with theſe words, and the God of all Conſolation be with you. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <p>THeſe words are part of Chriſts own Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of, and Apology for a very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable work of an Holy Woman, which nevertheleſs, through their great miſtake, came under a very ſevere cenſure at the hands of the very Diſciples of Chriſt themſelves, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.6. who taking knowledge only of ſo much therein, as occured to their ſenſe and carnal reaſon; admitted thereby not a little diſquiet on their own ſpirits (<hi>they had indignation,</hi> verſ. 4. <hi>they murmured,</hi> verſ. 5.) and reflected much trouble upon hers, <hi>verſ.</hi> 6. Even ſuch high-raiſed and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly actions of Saints, as have the moſt choiceſt eſteem and acceptance with the Lord, may yet meet with very undue repreſentations, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:40849:65"/> very ſtrange reflections from the hands of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers truly dear to Chriſt. It ſhould therefore be no greater ſtrange thing to us to be judged by mans judgement, its well we ſtand or fall to another Maſter.</p>
                  <p>But ſo well was the integrity of her ſpirit, and the noble principles, and ſprings of this action known to Chriſt, and approved by him, that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf undertakes her defence (when perhaps her trouble at their hard meaſure, might ſtop her own mouth) and appears to plead her cauſe not only ſo far as to give a preſent check to their raſh conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and a teſtimony to the goodneſs and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſs of her work: but withal takes order by an unalterable appointment for perpetuating the praiſe thereof, <hi>verſ.</hi> 9. <hi>That where ever the Goſpel of Grace ſhould be Preached throughout the world, this that ſhe had done ſhould be declared for a Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial of her.</hi> Chriſtians under cloudy cenſures loſe nothing at laſt by leaving their cenſured ſelves and actings, to be vindicated by the Lord, to whom their integrity is known, and their cauſe commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>Micah</hi> 7.9, 10.</p>
                  <p>Where ever the Doctrine of the Grace of Chriſt ſhould be proclaimed, this ſhould be produced as a lively inſtance, pattern, and example, to illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate and confirm the power and prevalency there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, in that it is of power to beget on ſo contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible a weak veſſel as this poor Woman was, ſuch exceeding largeneſs, nobility, and ingenuity of ſpirit, as was beyond what the gallanteſt principles or endeavours of meer Man could arrive unto; and yet when the memorial hereof was to be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, when the Goſpel ſhould be Preached ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:40849:65" rendition="simple:additions"/> to Nations abroad, or Generations to come, the principal intendment was not meerly to affix a mark of honour upon this individual perſon, or this ſingle act (for her very name is hid both here, <hi>verſ.</hi> 3 and in <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.6, 7.) but to commend and advance the value of the principles and motives ſhe went upon, to the encouragement and admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of us, and others, upon whom the ends of the World are come, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.11. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.4.

                  <p>All <hi>Nations</hi> where the <hi>Goſpel</hi> comes, muſt expreſly take notice (for a pattern to all that ſhall believe) what a value and eſtemation Chriſt had of, and an apology for a cenſured act of a glorious ſoul, laid out early and nobly upon what concerned him, when under a ſentence of <hi>death and burial,</hi> by the wiſe appointment of God (though to be executed by the hands of wicked men) ſo that if it might not be preſerved from rage and ſcorn, yet ſhould from ſtench and an evil ſavour, as much as lay in her, till its hoped-for Reſurrection ſhould ſet it above either what ſhe could do for it, or the enemies againſt it; may we therefore in our capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties learn that leſſon, <hi>Go and do likewiſe,</hi> Luke 10.37. In handling this Point I ſhall not confine my ſelf to any other method, than will offer it ſelf in conſidering this lively inſtance and pattern to Believers in the Text; what was the peculiar excellency of her act indiſcernable to good men
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:40849:68"/> that were ſtanders by, and wherein the acceptable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs lay, and thence by way of proportion where the cogent reaſon and influence of it lyes, reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us at this day.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Then we may conſider the inward ſprings and motives of her action that lay hid from ordinary obſervation, upon which her ſpirit was raiſed, and her endeavours extended to this degree mentioned in the Text.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>We may conſider the effect of theſe lively and ennobling principles, manifeſting its ſelf in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentions of her activity, or how it was ſaid of her, She did what ſhe could.</hi>

                     <pb n="116" facs="tcp:40849:69"/>1. There lay at the bottom of her act, a lively faith, ſtrong and operative in this very matter; not only in receiving the diſcoveries of the death and burial of her Lord, whereunto the Diſciples were ſo generally unacquainted, but alſo the aſſurance of his ſpeedy Reſurrection, not only in the hints that himſelf had given of it, but alſo from the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony that the Spirit had long ſince born, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 16.10. that <hi>he ſhould not ſee corruption in the grave,</hi> his early witneſs whereunto we have, <hi>John.</hi> 2.19. ſpeaking of the Temple of his body, <hi>verſ.</hi> 20. he ſaith, <hi>Deſtroy this Temple, and in three dayes I will raiſe it up again:</hi> Till he was riſen from the dead, this was not underſtood, or at leaſt not regarded and remembred (<hi>verſ.</hi> 22.) by the Diſciples; only ſuch and ſo great, apprehenſive and active, was the Faith of this good Woman, that ſhe receives the Doctrine of the Death and Burial, and quick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection from the Grave, of her dear Lord, and accordingly put her ſelf to this great Coſt, to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie her complyance with the Promiſe, that he ſhould be buried, but not ſubjected to that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and putrefaction that attends that ſtate and condition of all others. We reade of the ſame <hi>Mary, Joh.</hi> 11.2. in conjunction with her Siſter <hi>Martha,</hi> that when they were concerned in the burial of their Brother <hi>Lazarus,</hi> though there was no want but rather a ſuperabundance of love to him, living and dying: Chriſt <hi>loved him,</hi> Joh. 11.35, 36. The Diſciples loved him, for they could be content to <hi>go and die with him,</hi> verſ. 16. His Siſters loved him to ſome exceſs, <hi>verſ.</hi> 31. and yet becauſe they had no expectation of his Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on till the general Reſurrection, <hi>verſ.</hi> 24. they
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:40849:69"/> yielded him up to corruption, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.13, 14. ſo that when he had been dead four dayes, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded by this time he ſtinketh, <hi>verſ.</hi> 39. plainly ſhewing, that having not any faith, or fore-ſight of his return to life again ſo ſpeedily, they were at no coſt to embalm or perfume him againſt the ſtench of the Grave: but touching him whom God would raiſe up from the Grave not to ſee corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, (wherein he tranſcended <hi>David</hi> who wrote that <hi>Pſalm,</hi> who having ſerved his generation, by the Will of God fell aſleep, was laid to his Fathers, and ſaw corruption) <hi>Acts</hi> 13.34, to the 37. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.24. to the 32. So true and ſtrong was her Faith herein, that ſhe deals not with him as with <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> but afore-hand anoints him; and after he was in the Grave, again prepares another Confection of choice Embalm to perfect what might be lack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the former, <hi>Luke</hi> 23.56. <hi>Mark</hi> 16.1. by which we may perceive that Faith (and ſuch as was not found in <hi>Iſrael</hi> ordinarily) lay at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, and contributed aid and influence to all theſe great acts, and to this particularly wherein ſhe did what ſhe could for Chriſt. In juſt proportion here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, and on the ſame reaſon, is there need of Faith unfeigned, even Faith of the operation of God, to ingage ſouls to ſhew the like reſpect to the dying Cauſe, Intereſt, and Concernments of Jeſus Chriſt. Other men (and they alſo good men in the main) generally give it over, when ſuch diſtreſs and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pangs come on it, till Chriſt come in the clouds of Glory, eſpecially where the grounds of their carnal and creaturely expectations of its revival do periſh and fail; none have ſuch engagements on them to lay out themſelves in preparing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:40849:70"/> imbalm for it, (of which mention is made hereafter) but they who have upon Goſpel, and unmixed principles, an inſight into, and a fore-ſight of the deſign of God to give it an effectual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving and Reſurrection. The Faith then of this Reſurrection is the needful principle to enlarge ſouls in ſuch a caſe to do what they can for Chriſt's ſake.</p>
                  <p n="2">2dly. There was alſo in the bottom of this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous cenſured act of hers, fervent love in its live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly operation; which is a large and defuſive principle actuating ſouls upon very noble and unparallel'd exploits: its power and tendency to do ſo, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends its ſelf in that ample character and deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Apoſtle gives of it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. throughout. We have a very particular account of this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple brought forth to evidence by our Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in an act of like coſt and ſignification in the beginning of her way of following Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 7.47. ſhe there <hi>v.</hi> 37. <hi>brings an Alabaſter box of Oyntment, and with it anoints his feet</hi> (having as the <hi>chap.</hi> ſhews) <hi>waſhed them with her tears, and wiped them with the hair of her head.</hi> This perfume, though it filled the houſe with its odour, yet was little underſtood, in its ſpring and principle, by them that ſate by; but Jeſus diſcovers it, <hi>verſ.</hi> 47. Much was forgiven her, therefore <hi>ſhe loved much;</hi> there was much love in her ſoul on work, and hence ſhe layes out her ſelf much upon her Lord; the love of Chriſt conſtrains her, and this, though it was to work ſo early, yet was not ſoon expended, but rather increaſed more and more; neither was it clouded, or abated by the expectation of an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching death and funeral, but herein alſo puts
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:40849:70"/> out its ſelf, doth what it could towards his burial. Love makes her follow Chriſt not only in life but in death alſo, at his death to ſee the utmoſt of him, and do the utmoſt for him; compare <hi>Luke</hi> 23.27, 28, 55, 56. <hi>chap.</hi> 24.1. &amp; <hi>Joh.</hi> 19.25. <hi>chap.</hi> 20.1. &amp; <hi>Mark</hi> 15.40, 41, 47. you may perceive how Love led them from place to place, where Hazard might ſeem to way-lay them, and how unſatisfied they were with what others did tending this way: It was not the fine linnen <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea</hi> bought; it was not the newneſs of the Sepulchre hewed out of a Rock, in which never man lay, but fitted (it ſeems) for himſelf, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.59, 60. nay, it was not the coſtly bed of Spices that <hi>Nicodemas</hi> laid him in, <hi>John</hi> 19.29, 40. could ſatisfie them, but there muſt be more Spices bought to this end, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.1. Love is ſtrong as Death, <hi>all the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of a mans houſe will be contemned in the purſuit of it,</hi> Cant. 8.6, 7. In like manner will it be where a ſoul or people have, from the love of Chriſt ſhed abroad in their hearts, a ſutable reflexion on the things of Chriſt, they being ſo apprehenſive of, and enamoured with the unalterable beauty of them, as theſe deaths and burials they meet withal do not alter the complexion of them, or abate of that dear love and ſtreaming affection to them; where it dieth they will die, and there will they be buried, nothing but death, nay death it ſelf will not be able to ſeparate 'twixt it and them, <hi>Ruth</hi> 1.16, 17. their own lives will not be dear to them for its ſake, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.30. <hi>Acts</hi> 15.26. <hi>chap.</hi> 20.24. <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.11.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> But let us proceed to conſider the Effect of theſe noble and innobling Principles of
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:40849:71"/> Faith and Love in this affait in the Text; and alſo in the like on the Children of God at this day, where the work of Faith and Love with Power are produced; this commends it ſelf in the extent of ſuch acts as are performed, <hi>ſhe did what ſhe could;</hi> the commendable latitude of her ſpirit and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, is a qualification well worthy a little en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, <hi>When may a ſoul be ſaid to have done what he could?</hi> This and the like expreſſions, when they are applyed to ſet forth the Lords acceptance of a ſouls inlarged endeavours after, or for himſelf, do not ſignifie ſuch a perfection of intention, or act as denotes perfection, which is not capable of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe or addition. The choiceſt Saints in their higheſt ſervices and attainments this way, have found cauſe to cry out when they have done all that they could (at the beſt rate) yet <hi>they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable ſervants,</hi> Luke 17.20. here is no place for Pride; <hi>boaſting is excluded by the Law of Faith, Rom.</hi> 3.27.</p>
                  <p>The expreſſion it ſelf, however applied here to the commendation of this good Woman, yet im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies ſome degrees of imperfection, and ſuppoſes the act in ſome reſpects to be ſhort of abſolute compleatneſs; As for Inſtance,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Firſt, Though ſhe did, and a Chriſtian in his higheſt endeavours may have done what he could, yet may it be very ſhort of having done <hi>what he ſhould;</hi> there lies a very vaſt diſproportion moſt times betwixt the perfection of the Law, and the utmoſt attainments of our act, ſuch as may hide pride from us. <hi>The Law of the Lord is perfect, Pſal.</hi> 19.7. <hi>The Law is holy, and the Commandment holy, just, and good,</hi> Rom, 7, 12. <hi>The Law is ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:40849:71"/> verſ.</hi> 14. Indeed the Holy God, who is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection it ſelf, can require nothing leſs than per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection for ſutable converſe with himſelf, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.48. Now between this perfect rule, and our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect act, what proportion can there be? I am carnal, ſold under ſin, our unſpeakable mercy lies in the new and living way of Gods own appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to preſent our ſelves and ſervices without ſpot, and without blemiſh to himſelf; not through the works of Righteouſneſs that we have wrought, but according to his own mercy and grace, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he makes us accepted in the Beloved.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly, Though ſhe did, and a Chriſtian may be ſaid to <hi>do what he could;</hi> yet may there be, and many times there is a great ſhortneſs of <hi>doing what he would;</hi> as there is a diſproportion betwixt the Act and Law of which a poor Saint often com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains; So is there betwixt his heart and hand, or (as Chriſt tenderly excuſeth it in his Diſciples) betwixt a Spirit that is willing, and the Fleſh that is weak, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.41. This is that the Apoſtle in the perſon of a poor Child of God complains, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. <hi>We cannot do the things we would.</hi> And <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.15. to the 21. he finds a Law, <hi>that when he would do good, evil is preſent.</hi> Here now is a Chriſtians caſe, and the comfort concerning his act, when in all his apprehended ſhortneſs he finds a true gracious principle that delights in the Law of God, and preſſeth after a perfect union with, and a ſimilitude to it, groaning under, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting to his utmoſt, with the contradictions of his infirm ſelf: where this is indeed and in truth obvious to the ſearching eye of Chriſt, he puts that bleſſed conſtruction on it, as to his Diſciples,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:40849:72"/> the <hi>Spirit indeed is willing, &amp;c.</hi> and the <hi>Spirit teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth,</hi> 2 Cor. 8.12. <hi>That if there be firſt a willing mind, it is accepted according to what a man hath, and not according to what he hath not.</hi> We ſerve not an hard Maſter that requires impoſſibilities, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects beyond what he hath inabled for. He was judged a wicked and ſlothful Servant who had formed up that dreadful apprehenſion of a ſevere and cruel Maſter, <hi>that reaped where he did not ſow, and gathered where he did not ſtraw,</hi> Mat. 25.24, 26. We have a very choice character of the diſpoſition of the Lord toward the off-ſpring of a willing mind, <hi>Mark</hi> 12.42. to the end; a <hi>Widow caſt into the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury two mites, that make a farthing;</hi> a very ſmall and inconſiderable thing for the bulk of it, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the product of a noble mind, and being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to all that ever ſhe had, ſhe had done all what ſhe could, and this hath more acceptable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment and high commendation, than the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny rich, who caſt in much of their abundance; they might have (comparatively to her) narrow ſpirits, though they had larger Purſſes. Hence was the commendation of the Churches of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.2, 3. The deep poverty was matched with abounding riches of liberality, and then to their power, and beyond their power, they were willing of their own ſelevs, and that was on this principle, <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. <hi>Firſt they gave their own ſelves to the Lord, and to us by the will of God.</hi> Souls yielded up to the Lord are the only generous ſpirits. The greatneſs of <hi>Davids</hi> joy, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.14, 17, 18. was not ſo much for the greatneſs of the gift, but the willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and uprightneſs of the heart (his own and others) that drew them out to do what they could
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:40849:72" rendition="simple:additions"/> for the Houſe of God. But a little more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to attempt the reſolution of this enquiry, <hi>When a ſoul may be ſaid to do what he can for Chriſt?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Firſt, We only then do what we can, when our ſpirits are bending and preſſing toward an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance and increaſe of act, according as we find the concernments of Chriſt about which we are converſant, requires or needs it, when as we ſee the diſtreſs of it increaſe, there grows upon us daily the care of theſe concerns, as we ſee the dayes are evil, wicked men worſe and worſe, and good men faint and weary, we then lay about us: What excellent thing do we, can we do, what do we more than others? Its the guiſe of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Profeſſors, when they ſee Chriſts things go to the Wall (as we ſay) then to ſtudy Prudence and Wiſdom, things good in themſelves and in their place, but what do they ſignifie here but a meer politick contrivance how to preſerve themſelves by an abatement of their zeal, a temperament and qualification of the height and ſtrickneſs of their Profeſſion, the diſpoſition of ſuch tends this way, they will do as little as they can for Chriſt; They hope they may be ſaved if they meet not ſo often, nor ſo publick, nor ſo many as formerly, until at length their prudence will be to leave Chriſt alone, and repair to, and care for their own things. Nay it will be well if it turn not them aſide to their crooked wayes, where God hath threatned to lead them forth with the workers of iniquity. Oh! where are thoſe ſtirrings of ſpirit, when we ſee a City, a Nation wholly given to Idolatry, ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the more publick, frequent, and fervent ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:40849:73"/> on Gods behalf, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.16. That would have entred into the Theatre had he been ſuffered, <hi>Acts</hi> 19.13, 31. That when the Decree is ſigned, of death without mercy, yet will keep on, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Moral but Inſtituted Worſhip, to the utmoſt as aforetime, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.10. Raſhneſs is not here plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, but a zeal of God according to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and an holy fervency of ſpirit, ſerving the Lord, rejoycing in Hope, patient in Tribulation, continuing inſtant in Prayer, not forſaking the aſſembling our ſelves, though the manner of ſome be ſo; but exhort one another daily while it is day, provoking to Love and good Works, and that ſo much the more as we ſee the dayes be evil, and that day approacheth.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly, We then do what we can when we make it our care and buſineſs to get our ſpirits and frames in all we do, raiſed on more noble prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples than formerly; Goſpel-principles are not revealed to us, or improved by us to their height at firſt; <hi>The Righteouſneſs of God is revealed from Faith to Faith,</hi> Rom. 1.17. <hi>Who walk by it from ſtrength to ſtrength,</hi> Pſal. 84.7. <hi>And are changed from glory to Glory,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.18. They that reſt in, and truſt to former Attainments and Experiences, will find them ſhort of furniſhing for new ſervices of Sufferings: We have need, in theſe thorny and rocky paths, to have our ſhoos of iron and braſs, and as the day is, ſo ſhould our ſtrength be, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.25. We have need not only to prefer that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, <hi>Lord help our unbelief;</hi> but alſo, <hi>Lord in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe our Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thirdly, We do what we can then, when we improve our utmoſt intereſt in others; Saints
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:40849:73"/> and Sinners do ingage them to do what they can for Chriſt, when the diſtreſs is publick and extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to others generally; it ſhould not ſatisfie our ſpirits, to narrow up our care and endeavour within the compaſs of our own things. It was a ſad com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, <hi>All ſeek their own,</hi> Phil. 2.21. <hi>Ye ſhall be ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered every one to his own,</hi> Joh. 16.32. This good Woman in the Text doth not ſatisfie her ſelf, to make preparation for the embalming her dear Lord, but ſhe is ſtill found accompanying and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging others with her, <hi>Luke</hi> 23.55, 56. &amp; <hi>chap.</hi> 24.10. Our forwardneſs and zeal, as was theirs of <hi>Macedonia, which provoked very many,</hi> 2 Cor. 9.2. Alas! we are debtors to others, both Saints and Sinners, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.14, 15. And we ſhould do as much as lies in us, to get them engaged to Chriſt as deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to him, <hi>chap.</hi> 8.12. Oh! did the worth and need of ſouls preſs more upon us, we ſhould not be ſo private ſpirited as we ſeem to be, in reſpect of the diſperſing the knowledge of the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, but ſhould be more ready and leſs afraid to ſuffer all things for the Elects ſake, that they (be they converted, or unconverted) may alſo obtain the Salvation which is in Chriſt Jeſus with eternal Glory, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.10. Oh! ſtrive and ſtudy to do then what you can for Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>But here it may be requiſite (ere we go further) to remove out of the way ſome of theſe deceits of Satan, whereby it is uſual with him, to wrap many poor ſouls in their ſelf-pleaſing, but indeed to their detriment and undoing. How frequently doth it occur to our obſervation, That it is the pretention of many Profeſſors who ſeek their eaſe in <hi>Sion,</hi> as well as of prophane perſons, that though they do
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:40849:74"/> but little in the great &amp; momentous matters of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, yet they do what they can, they ſay; and if God accept the will for the deed, what need ſo much clamour to preſs them further? God is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful, and why ſhould we be ſo over-ſtrict? will we have men do more than they can do? To free the Scripture from ſuch corrupt gloſſes, and forewarn and deliver our ſelves from ſuch inſnaring temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to eaſe and ſlumber, let us conſider, That there are divers luſts of a very narrowing debaſing tendency, within the Circles of which Satan at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to bring poor ſouls in ſuch dayes as theſe, and then ſhrinks and ſhrivels them upon all quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that they can do no excellent thing for Chriſt: Its a pitiful, its a dreadful thing to think to excuſe our want of activity for God, upon the account of the ſtraits that ſuch temptations and iniquities lead us into; this is to cover with a covering that is not of the Spirit, that they may add ſin to ſin, which hath a woe pronounced on it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.1. <hi>chap.</hi> 28.20.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Firſt, Satan doth endeavour what he can, to debaſe Souls, by filling them with carnal and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing diſcouragements; this exceedingly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableth them from attempting any thing that is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent. Its but little ſuch a one can do; and its a pitiful account he can give of having done what he could; beſides the common diſcouragement that ariſeth from the perſecution at the hands of wicked and ungodly men, the nature and tendency of which diſcouragement is frequently ſpoken un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to (and I ſhall here paſs by.) There are ſundry that are apt to ariſe from good men themſelves, in thoſe cenſures, and miſs-judgings that forward
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:40849:74" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſouls meet frequently in the way; and indeed they wound very deep: Had it been an enemy I could have born it, but it was thou, a man, my friend, and my familiar, &amp;c. this cut deep. To apply only to what is in the Text, it was in the opening of the Context noted, that this grand work of hers that had ſuch an eminent commendation from Chriſt himſelf, as ſpringing from more Faith and Love than ordinary, fell yet under ſuch ſevere judging of the Diſciples themſelves, that it put the ſoul of this good woman into no ſmall trouble, <hi>Mark</hi> 14.6. <hi>Let her alone, why trouble you her?</hi> If we note a few of the offences they had at her, and objected againſt her; and by comparing them, we ſhall find that they have an exact ſimilitude to the <hi>Cavils</hi> at this day, ſtarted againſt the zealous Saints; under which it may quiet us to conſider that they are no new, and therefore ſhould be no ſtrange thing to us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cavil</hi> 1. There was no prudence uſed in this act, this ſeems to lye at the bottom of their ſenſe: wiſe men would not have done like this fooliſh Woman thought they, and at this they had indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation within themſelves, <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. and murmured againſt her; they were in a very pettiſh and impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient fit, as if they had ſaid, theſe unpreſidential actings will make a great noiſe to little profit, and at length ſpoyl all our prudential reaſonings. But now when they are improved, without due regard to the great intereſt of Chriſt, which ought to be laid and cared for in the firſt place; they prove great offences, not only to hinder ſuch contrivers themſelves, but to obſtruct others who were fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Chriſt, and would be induced to follow
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:40849:75"/> him, in more faithfulneſs, courage, and ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                  <p n="2">2dly. A breach of the law of Charity was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, the ſaving what ſhe had for her ſelf, the providing for the Poor, the ſupplying the Bag that Chriſt and his Diſciples lived upon, are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be damnified and neglected hereby; Mercy ſhould have been preferred before zealous Sacrifice, &amp;c. This is a uſual Objection, but there is more of <hi>Judas</hi> in it, than many that are offended by it are aware of, <hi>John</hi> 12.6. Charity to bodies is pretended and advanced hereby frequently, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Love to Chriſt, and Charity to poor ſouls; they may ſtarve and die for want of a word of Life rather than ſuch loſſes muſt be ſuffered, ſuch haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards run, ſuch coſt expended.</p>
                  <p n="3">3dly. The thing was let run at waſte, was ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Objection: Chriſt had no need of it, he was ſweet without it, and it was early enough for his funeral; her love was known without ſuch coſtly characters. Is not this a common way of reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? Cannot the Goſpel be preached, the Cauſe of Chriſt ſecured, the Profeſſion of Chriſt upheld, unleſs you, ſuch poor weak ones as you, muſt make a noiſe, and run your ſelves and others upon ruine? you will be brought to beggary, your families ruined, then who muſt maintain you? Chriſt is in Glory, the everlaſting Goſpel will be preached in due time, in the midſt of Heaven the Elect will be called, and we that are Chriſts ſhall go to Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, though you never make ſuch a-do. This is uſual, and apt to diſcourage; yet ought indeed to ſignifie little with gracious ſouls, who know that God doth ſet them for the defence of the Goſpel,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:40849:75"/> as a pillar and ground of Truth, being his wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes againſt an adulterous generation, before whom ſhould they be aſhamed to profeſs him; the ſtones will cry out, and Chriſt would be aſhamed of them before his Father, and the holy Angels; but in this their faithful teſtimony, though friends ſcorn them, <hi>Job</hi> 16.20. yet by Prayer and Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, committing themſelves, and the pleading their cauſe to God, he will in due time plead their cauſe, and take up the controverſie as he did this poor Womans, when they that have judged them ſhall be aſhamed: This then is the firſt caution, Take heed that your hearts be not diſquieted by ſuch weakning diſcouragements from without, or within, leſt you be weary and faint in your minds, and thereby become diſabled from doing excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent things; think not that God will own and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the reſult of ſuch wind-ſhaken-minds, and put this mark of favour on it, <hi>She did what ſhe could.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly, Another ſinful Circle, within which Satan endeavours to conjure the ſpirits of many Profeſſors, and therein narroweth and ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth them from any capacity to do what they might for Chriſt, is becauſe, the buſineſs, and ſpirit of the world, buſieth them with <hi>Martha's</hi> lot in many things, and then they think they have as good excuſe for their neglects as had ſhe, that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as much as nothing, it muſt paſs, becauſe they do what they could. This is very lamentable, though frequently ſpoken to; it remains the guiſe of many Profeſſors, You know my buſineſs, what a deal of work I have, ſaith one: What a deal of care and deſtraction I have, ſaith another: Juſt as
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:40849:76"/> they that were bidden to the Wedding-Supper; one had bought a Farm, and he muſt go and ſee it; another had bought a yoke of Oxen, and he muſt go and try them; another had married a Wife, and therefore he cannot come; all deſire, Pray have me excuſed; all begin to make excuſe with one conſent, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.18. You may reade one word, and ſee how badly ſuch excuſes will ſtand in the day of Chriſt, when not one of thoſe that were bidden, ſhall taſte of the Supper, <hi>v.</hi> 24. Oh! when mens hands are ſo full of buſineſs, and that moſt times greedily and unneceſſarily ſought after and purſued, that they cannot come; or at leaſt their hearts ſo over-charged with the cares and pleaſures of it, that they cannot come to any purpoſe; what doth this portend, but ſome ſwift ſtroak at hand on ſuch a fooliſh people, to make up that lamentation? <hi>Jer.</hi> 9.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thirdly, A third advantage Satan gets on many, by which he incloſeth them within their ſpiritual benumedneſs, That they can do very little for God, and yet pleaſe themſelves, is the old uſual complaint (and that not without cauſe, though moſt times without ſenſe) <hi>of a bad dead cold heart;</hi> when this ſeems to be the Religion of people, and that, from whence they get, or would get, not only excuſe for their ſhortneſs, but a ſuppoſition that they are very humble, tender, ingenious, watchful, experimental, becauſe they are ſo able and apt to tell of, and mourn over bad hearts; but hardly have I ever obſerved a people ſo inclinable to the deepeſt hypocriſie, and palpable neglect of any ſpiritual means to make them better; but as the door turns upon the hinges, ſo do they upon ſuch
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:40849:76"/> complaints, till what they artificially complain of at firſt, ſpring up at length as a Leproſie in their foreheads, to be ſeen and read of all men.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Fourthly, Another ſinful boundary wherein Satan wraps many, and diſableth them from doing any thing excellent for Chriſt (and then they think it well enough, if they do what they can within their compaſs) is, <hi>The offence of Spirit that is apt to grow either at the ways or people of Chriſt, becauſe of the imperfection, they eſpie or ſuppoſe to be found in them:</hi> But, <hi>bleſſed is he that is not offended in Chriſt,</hi> Mat. 11.6. Such diſtemper is dangerous, eſpecially in ſuch a dark ſtate of things, wherein that word ſeems verified, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.31. <hi>This night ſhall ye be offended becauſe of me:</hi> When Profeſſors are apt on all hands to ſtagger and fall into ſin, providences frown, opportunities of ſerving God cannot be come at without apparent hazard; ſpirits of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple grow froward, apt to catch at advantages, glad to find excuſes, for departure from Relation to one another, hard to be reconciled; this is a bad ſeaſon for ſouls apt to ſtumble at the ſtumbling-ſtone: It begins with this, I am not free to meet, pray with, hear, joyn with ſuch a one (although all acts of Chriſtian duty for removing offence are neglected) and at length it appears, that of whom one is overcome, of him he is brought into bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage. Oh! ſtudy to preſerve the unity of the ſpirit in the bond of peace; Great peace have ſuch as love the Law of Chriſt, and nothing ſhall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Fifthly, To name no more at preſent, Satan gets hold on many, by pleaſing them under a ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, ſinful abuſe of this notion, <hi>We can do nothing,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:40849:77"/> without we have help from the Lord:</hi> The which way of reckoning, as it is moſt commonly abuſed, hath this ſignification, All the idle neglects of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors ſhall be as much (as they durſt for modeſty expreſs themſelves) fathered upon God. As the firſt way of Satan to cover the mans iniquity, was, <hi>The Woman that thou gaveſt to be with me, ſhe gave me, &amp;c.</hi> as if he had ſaid, Hadſt thou not given me a Woman, I had not ſinned: the evil lies at leaſt between us; but from all ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes, God will be clear when he is judged.</p>
                  <p>This may ſerve as a taſte, That its not every <hi>I can do no more,</hi> will ſerve the turn to excuſe us, much leſs obtain for us this bleſſed Teſtimony Chriſt gave of this Woman, <hi>She hath done what ſhe could, ſhe hath come aforehand to anoint my Body to the burial.</hi> You may do more than you do all of you; nay, all things conſidered, muſt do more than this perfuming-work, of which I ſhall ſpeak a little more particularly to ſhew its ſpecial nature, when I have firſt offered a few Conſiderations, ſhewing what engagements do lie on us, to do what we can for Chriſt, eſpecially in this buſineſs of begetting a good ſavour on his things, in this day, when they are expoſed, as much as may be, to ſtink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Firſt, We are concerned to do what we can for Chriſt in this reſpect, becauſe Chriſt hath done what he can to put a ſweet ſavour upon us, when we ſtank to purpoſe; and doth not ingenuity require that we put the queſtion the Prophet did, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 4.13. <hi>Thou haſt been careful for us with all this care; what is to be done for thee?</hi> Or, as the <hi>Pſalmiſt, Pſal.</hi> 116.12. <hi>What ſhall I render to the Lord for all
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:40849:77"/> his benefits?</hi> eſpecially when he looks for nothing but our returning on his Name, the reflection of the ſweet ſavour that he hath beſtowed on us; let's but conſider, what <hi>great things</hi> (of this kind) <hi>he hath done for us,</hi> 1 Sam. 12.24. What were we when he caſt a look of Love upon us? <hi>Our navel was not cut, nor waſhed in water at all, not ſalted at all, nor ſwadled at all; caſt out in the open field in our bloud, to the loathing of our perſon, troden under in bloud, &amp;c. Ezek.</hi> 16.4, 5, 6. The ſtench of a ſoul in ſuch a plight, may be read <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38.3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Well, to take away this evil ſavour, What hath Chriſt done in his Oblation? <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.2. <hi>Gave himſelf an offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and a ſacrifice to God for a ſweet ſmelling ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</hi> What doth he by conſtant Interceſſion? <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.2, 3. ſtands with much Incenſe to offer up the perſons and ſervices of Saints, with accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as a cloud of perfume aſcending up before God out of his hand. All the offerings under the Law, both on the Brazen Altar for Sacrifice, and on the Golden Altar of Incenſe, are only figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of what Chriſt doth this way; of all which its ſo frequently ſignified, Its an offering made by fire, of a ſweet ſavour before the Lord. What doth he by beſtowing his Spirit in the work of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, but anoint with precious oyntment, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.9, 10, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or, as was the manner of Kings to prepare for their intimate Communion, <hi>Eſth.</hi> 2.12. What is the diſplaying his Name, but an oyntment poured out, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.3. What are his Appearances, ſmelling of Myrrhe, Aloes, and Caſſia, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.8. and all to make us glad? Are not the kiſſes of his lips for that end perfumed, to that end, to convey to us a ſavour of them,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:40849:78"/> 
                     <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.13. What, I ſay, doth all this ſpeak, and ſignifie, if not an obligation that we ſhould be a ſweet ſavour to him, and leave a ſavour of him in every place, in ſuch eſpecially, as wherein his Name is or may be defamed, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14, 15, 16. Oh! let our garments be alwayes white, let our head and heart want no oyntment, to pour out as there is occaſion, liberally and bountifully, when in any ſenſe (as was ſaid of the Colt, <hi>Mark</hi> 11.3.) <hi>the Lord hath need of it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2dly. Its but reaſonable we ſhould do what we can to bring up a ſweet ſavour upon the things of Chriſt, if we call to remembrance, <hi>What coſt and pains we have been at,</hi> (to repreſent that ſavoury, which is pollution, and rottenneſs it ſelf, I mean) <hi>to beautifie and accommodate any ſtinking luſt;</hi> unto which we were bound, though in ſo doing, we <hi>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured in the very fire, and wearied our ſelves for very vanity,</hi> Habak. 2.13. For who can bring up a clean ſweet ſavour on that which is ſo unclean? Shall we beſtow ſuch endeavour to perfume a dunghil luſt? and ſhall not we much more lay out our ſelves now upon things that are of an excellent na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, on whom God hath determined to beſtow ſuch weights of Glory? ſee the diſpoſition and drudgery of a poor ſinner in ſeeking to keep up a part at a diſtance from God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.9, 10. <hi>Thou wenteſt to the King with oyntment, and didſt increaſe thy perfumes, and didſt ſend thy meſſengers far off, and didſt debaſe thy ſelf, even to Hell; thou art wearied in the greatneſs of thy way, yet ſaidſt thou not, There is no hope, &amp;c.</hi> What Oyntments, what Perfumes, what Coſt, what Trouble was there expended by this poor wretch, to bring about his intereſt in a
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:40849:78"/> way agreeable to his own luſt, and wretched heart of apoſtaſie, debaſing its ſelf, even to Hell? and ſhall we be ſo loath to lay our ſelves out to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in ſuch oyntments and perfumes, as are on ſo bleſſed an object, and to ſo advantagious an end as is now propoſed? Shall the whoriſh Woman, <hi>Prov.</hi> 7.17, 18. perfume her Bed with Myrrhe, Aloes, and Cynamon, to ſatisfie and fill her ſelf and her luſt with greater content; and are we ſo loth to prepare ſuch a bed for our Lord's concerns till the day break and the ſhadows flye away. Oh! lets learn, that as we have yielded our members ſervants to uncleanneſs and to iniquity; even ſo now let us yield our ſelves ſervants to Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and to Holineſs: <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.9. What fruits had we in theſe things, whereof we are now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed?</p>
                  <p n="3">3dly. We ſhould do all we can to raiſe a ſweet ſavour, for that the adverſaries of Chriſt do all they can to beget a ſtench upon the things of which we ſpeak; they do what they can to make them as the filth of the world, and off-ſcouring of all things to this day; the Dung-carts of the world, into which every one throws the dirt and excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that they caſt out of their doors, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.13. If the Witneſſes of Chriſt be ſlain, <hi>their dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are not ſuffered to be put into graves, but lie in the ſtreets of the great City,</hi> Rev. 11.8, 9. Pſal. 79.1, 2, 3, 4. Pſal. 141.7. Ezek. 24.7. And why thus left a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove ground; but that (as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 34.3) <hi>their ſlain being caſt out, their ſtink may come out of their carkaſſes.</hi> Shall the enemies of Truth do what they can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Truth, as <hi>Pilate</hi> gave a charge, <hi>Ye have a Watch, make it as ſure as you can,</hi> Mat. 27.65.
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:40849:79"/> Were they at ſuch charge to debauch <hi>Judas,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch the Souldiers that watcht the Sepulchre? and all to make the intereſt of a dead Chriſt abhorred among men; and ſhall we not do what we can to cover, if not recover it? Should the men of <hi>Jabeſh</hi> adventure ſo deſperately to reſcue the dead bodies of <hi>Saul,</hi> and of his ſons, from the reproach of the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> and be at ſuch coſt to prepare a royal burning and burying for them? 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 31.12, 13. compared with 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.14. Shall the dead body of ſuch an enemy of the Lord's intereſt (as he was againſt <hi>David</hi>) be ſo honourably reſcued from the reproach of the Heathen? Shall not we do what we can for ſuch an inteteſt as Chriſts is, when it is thus reproached, and expoſed to ſcorn and contempt?</p>
                  <p n="4">4thly. God hath furniſhed us (the weakeſt and pooreſt amongſt us that are his) to do much that ſhall be very effectual and acceptable, this way, and to this end; diſcouragements then ſhould not hinder us from doing what we can to preſerve a a ſweet Name and ſavour to Chriſt. Many cry out, Alas! what can I do? what have I to bring, poor creature! were I as able as gifted, as well qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and furniſhed to Preach, Pray, Diſcourſe, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute as others, I might attempt ſomething. This reaſon is not right; its not Gifts but Graces (as I ſhall ſhew you hereafter) that ſend forth the moſt precious ſavour: and there may be an abounding of the latter of theſe in ſouls, to whom the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is denied. Nor doth the vertue of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balm indeed lie ſo much in the aboundance of act, as of acceptation; ſhe that caſt in what ſhe had, and therein did what ſhe could, though it were in
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:40849:79"/> value but two mites, yet it was accounted in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue more than two millions: The love of ſuch a poor ſoul to Chriſt is ſeen in a little token, and then the eſtimation of it you may reade, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.10. <hi>How fair is thy love, my ſiſter, my ſpouſe! how much better is thy love than wine! and the ſmell of thine oyntments, than all ſpices!</hi> If true love be in the compoſition, the ſmell of ſuch an oyntment, it is unparallel'd in Chriſts account. <hi>Goats-hair</hi> had its acceptance on and value from this conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Exod.</hi> 25.2, 4. and Women ſpinning it, whoſe ſpirits ſtirred them, <hi>Exod.</hi> 35.26.</p>
                  <p n="5">5thly. We ſhould do as much as we can for Chriſt, becauſe its a time and hour of temptation, wherein many Profeſſors (if not moſt) do as little as they can for ſhame, through the fear of what the after reckoning may coſt them more than the ſpices; Many are willing to be at much coſt to feaſt Chriſt when his intereſt is riſing, who have nothing to beſtow at his funeral; nay, its well if ſuch as cleave to Chriſt now, can paſs without the ſharpeſt cenſure from their very hands from whom better things might be expected. Such a one is a ſinner, <hi>Luke</hi> 7.29. Such a one is a waſter, <hi>Mark</hi> 14.3. are the ordinary thanks we muſt look to meet with from them that have been great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders to Chriſt. There is few <hi>Joſephs,</hi> few <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demases,</hi> that were but ſecret Diſciples, when all was well, who yet boldly witneſs againſt the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning of Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 23.51. boldly own and deſire him, when condemned, <hi>Mark</hi> 15.43. richly embalm and intombe him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 19.38, 39, 40, 41. Since it is ſo rare to find ſecret Profeſſors in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous times, grow bold aſſerters of him in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:40849:80"/> times; but on the conarary, moſt are offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at ſuch night-ſeaſons; forſake him and flee every one to his own and leave him alone, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.31. <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.32. It ſo much the more concerns us, if the love of Chriſt conſtrain us to appear the more ſtreniouſly for him, and lay out our ſelves upon him.</p>
                  <p n="6">6thly. We ſhould do all we can for Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God expects much from us this way, as the very end for which he hath raiſed us up, and brought us hither; he gives us this denomination, <hi>Ye are the Salt of the Earth, Mat.</hi> 5.13. Salt is good; its nature, uſe, and tendancy, is to preſerve from putrifaction and ſtench, things otherwiſe liable thereunto: if we loſe our ſaltneſs, our aptitude to preſerve a ſweet ſavour in our ſelves, and that whereabout we are eminently concerned, we are good for nothing, not good for the Earth, not good for the Dung-hill, but to be caſt out and troden under foot of men. Profeſſors that are unſavoury, nay, that are not ſavoury, and engaged to ſavour others in ſtinking times, they are, or are like to become the worſt of men. Our Intereſt is to preſs up to that character, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. A people by whom God maketh manifeſt the ſavour of his knowledge in every place, being unto God a ſweet ſavour of Chriſt in them that are ſaved, and in them that periſh. He that ſavoured of the things of men, more than things of God, 'twas an offence to Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.23. Its good to be as well what, as where God looks for a man to be, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in perilous times.</p>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:40849:80" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <p>This might ſerve to have been ſpoken to the Second general Head, propoſed to conſideration, in opening the Doctrine, how it might be ſaid, <hi>She did what ſhe could.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We proceed then to the Third thing, repreſented to our conſideration in this inſtance, namely, <hi>The buſineſs or affair it ſelf, about which ſhe was imployed;</hi> The which ſpiritually imitated and followed by us, is ſo much our concernment; <hi>She came aforehand to anoint his Body to the burying.</hi> Of her act in the ſtrict acceptation of it, and its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to the body of Chriſt's fleſh, that was then expreſly anointed by her, I ſhall not now ſpeak; the rather, becauſe (as ſuch) it is exalted at the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers right hand, not only far above the Grave (Death hath no more dominion over him) but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo above any poſſibility of being reached by any offers or attempts of ours, to add to the glory or ſavour of it. But he hath a Body alwayes with us, as I hinted in the explication of the terms, adequated, and expoſed to ſuch endeavours of ours, as is my principal deſign to promote. This ſeems not obſcurely hinted at, and intended in the <hi>verſe</hi> before the Text, at leaſt we may allude to it for illuſtration, <hi>You have the Poor with you alwayes, and whenſoever you will, you may do them good; but me ye have not alwayes.</hi> Thus, though the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens do and muſt contain the Body of Chriſt up in Glory, yet he hath myſtically and figuratively a Body of poor Saints alwayes with us upon the Earth; he hath a poor Cauſe and Intereſt, wherein he doth for glorious ends imba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="140" facs="tcp:40849:81"/> theſe many deaths and burials, wherein an ill ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour is frequently attending it; its a good work wrought on it, and ſuch as Chriſt takes exceeding kindly as done unto himſelf, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.40. When any proper attempts are made to preſerve this, from the bad ſavour that is incident to ſuch a ſtate of things, and uſually attends it.</p>
                  <p>Toward the better underſtanding therefore what properly concerns us in this caſe, as far as we may transfer it to our ſelves in this figure (not to ſpeak at large of the Body, Intereſt, or Concerns of Chriſt, expoſed to thoſe deaths, and propoſed to thoſe embalmings of ours, of which, and of this crucified ſtate of it, we have had when occaſion to treat) it ſhall ſuffice that we diſtinctly conſider theſe Two things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Firſt, <hi>What kind of ill ſavour is it, which this Body, Cauſe, and Intereſt of Chriſt is incident unto, and lyable to contract under the deaths and burials that muſt by the will of God attend it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly, <hi>What is the nature and compoſition of that Anointing or Embalming, which is proper to reſiſt a ſtench and putrifaction of ſuch a ſtate of things, in contributing whereunto Chriſt expects from us, that we ſhould do what we can?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1.

<pb n="141" facs="tcp:40849:81"/> them more comprehenſively, as they are cloathed and circumſtantiated with divers additaments that are of a lower nature and allay, yet ſo involved and complicated by the wiſe diſpoſal of divine providence, as tends in a direct obſervance, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh and bring about the deſigns thereof: in this reſpect many things which ſeem to ſtand rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in a way of preſent ſerviceableneſs to Chriſts intereſt, may, and will ſuffer ſuch conſumption as their own nature is liable unto; but in the former ſenſe, the things of Jeſus Chriſt that are propoſed to the care and ſeeking of the Saints, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.21. are by the power and vertue of the ſaid covenant, ſecured from any detriment tending to annihilati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but though deaths do often attend them, yet ſo ſtrong and effectual is their relation to Jeſus Chriſt, that becauſe he liveth, they ſhall live alſo; nay, though they die, they ſhall live again, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.25. Exceeding conſolatory is that word, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.19. <hi>Thy dead men ſhall live, together with my dead body ſhall they ariſe.</hi> The poor Saints were crying out before under the manifeſt diſappointments, and miſcarriage of all their ſtrong cryes and travel, <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. <hi>They are dead, they ſhall not live; they are deceaſed, they ſhall not riſe, &amp;c.</hi> But God would have his faithful ones know, that ſuch is the vertue of their relation to Chriſt as his dead body, that ſuch a Reſurrection is aſcertained to them, as ſhall not only deliver them from the power of the grave, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49.15. but manifeſt that their very death was gain and advantage to them, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.21. Their grave, a chamber of retirement, and bed of reſt, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.2. till ſome blaſt of indignation be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.13. It was indeed the diſtinguiſhing
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:40849:82"/> honour of the Captain of our Salvation, that in his conteſt with death and the grave, he ſaw no cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.25. to the 31. <hi>chap.</hi> 13.34. to the 37. In all things he hath the preheminence of <hi>David,</hi> to whom this Word of God came, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.11. (who doubtleſs ſucked much conſolation from it) it is ſignified he ſaw corruption in this ſence, that what of him is corruptible is ſubjected to that way of refining; <hi>Its ſown in corruption, but ſhall be raiſed in incorruption:</hi> His better and noble part being preſerved in an excellent way of living to God, <hi>Luke</hi> 20.37, 38. his fleſh alſo reſts in Hope. The corruption then, or any ill ſavour that may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe upon the intereſt of Chriſt thus conſidered, is not ſuch as tends to annihilation or utter diſſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the everlaſting purpoſes, covenant, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of God with Chriſt, ſecures it in a ſtate of Hope; neither doth this only and ſingly refer to the final Reſurrection of the whole in a way of compleat glory at the laſt day (which was <hi>Martha's</hi> narrowing miſtake about <hi>Lazarus,</hi> Joh. 11.24.) but ſhall be manifeſtly verified in ſuch eminent appearances of God, to get himſelf a glorious Name antecedently to that conſummating Glory, as ſhall anſwer and accompliſh a ſyſtem of bleſſed Promiſes, and promiſes of the Glory of the latter dayes, that ſhall be raiſed in the ruine of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and Reſurrection of the Witneſſes of Chriſt, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to prepare his people, for his glorious appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as a Bride adorned to meet the Bridegroom.</p>
                  <p>Its not ſuch a rottenneſs, or ſtinking, as <hi>Martha</hi> concluded <hi>Lazarus</hi> to be, which would conſume and eat him out, not be prevented, reſiſted, and cured till the Heavens be no more, <hi>Job</hi> 14.12.
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:40849:82"/> 
                     <hi>There is hope in its end,</hi> Jer. 31.17. 1 Theſ. 4.13. <hi>Though the Lord ſhew us great and ſore troubles, he will quicken us again, and bring us up again from the depths of the Earth,</hi> Pſal. 71.20. <hi>Though we walk in the midst of troubles, yet he will revive us,</hi> Pſal. 138.7. The mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken it, thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Promiſes are of mighty efficacy to embalm it. Nevertheleſs there is an ill ſavour on ſeveral accounts, that is apt to be brought upon this body, or intereſt of Chriſt, at ſuch times, under ſuch deaths as we ſpeak of, againſt which the embalm we treat of, is to be prepared; As namely,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There is a ſtinke apt to betide it, the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of which is meerly from without, ariſing from the rotten and corrupt diſpoſition of ſuch as are inſtrumental in bringing ſuch deaths upon it, who uſually account it their intereſt to expoſe it to all the ignominy and contempt imaginable, that in the abomination thereof, a foundation may be laid for the excuſing and commending themſelves, in delivering the world from ſuch a loathſome bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then. Thus they did with the green Tree, and no marvel if they do ſo with the dry. When they had in deſign to put the Lord of Glory to an open ſhame; what artifices had they to load him with all manner of ignominy both before and at his death, foretold by a ſpirit of propheſie, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.6, 7, 8. ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly fulfilled, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. <hi>He was ſcourged,</hi> verſ. 26. <hi>Stripped,</hi> verſ. 28. <hi>Mocked,</hi> verſ. 29. <hi>Spit upon; his head ſmitten,</hi> verſ. 30. <hi>Scoffed,</hi> and <hi>led to be Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi> verſ. 31. <hi>Scornfully inſcribed,</hi> verſ. 37. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viled by them that paſſed by, wagging their heads,</hi> verſ. 39. <hi>Mocked by the Chief Prieſts, Elders, and Scribes,</hi> verſ. 41.

And as they have done to him in his own perſon (who hid not his face from ſhame and ſpitting) ſo do they to thoſe that go forth to him without the Camp, bearing his reproach; <hi>They are made a ſpectacle to the World, to Angels, and to Men; Fools, weak, deſpiſed, hunger, thirſt, naked, buffetted, pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims, reviled, perſecuted, defamed, made the filth of the world, and off-ſcouring of all things to this day,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.9. to 13.

                     <hi>filth ſcraped off ſhooes;</hi> or from the pavement, or the dung-cart that goes through the City, into which every one brings his filth and caſts in.

This ſtench had need to be provided againſt by ſuch as would have his Name be as a precious Oyntment. Divers miſtake the right way of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming this, ſuppoſing that the beſt way of reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, is by repelling and retorting it with the ſame meaſure into their faces who lay it on. Chriſts method of imbalming is quite otherwiſe, namely, by bearing it with all patience, meekneſs, and holy reſignedneſs of the judgment to God, who knows how to make their own tongues to fall upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and their violent dealing upon their own pates. We have the high Inſtance and Example of Chriſt himſelf, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2, 23. <hi>Who when he was

                  <p>The former of theſe I ſhall propound under the Obſervation and Improvement of two or three words, in her caſe in the text, which may direct our care in this buſineſs.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That which we bring to the Lord on the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent intendment, muſt bear proportion to hers in this quality. Hers was (and ſo muſt ours be) very <hi>Pure</hi> Oyntment. The word <hi>Spiknard,</hi> the margent reads <hi>Pure-nard;</hi> ſome think it ſhould be tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright and Perfect Nard:</hi> They taking the word <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, and ſo ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie <hi>faithful, proper, pure, and unmixed Nard,</hi> it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing liable to be adulterated, vitiated, and corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. By due proportion whereunto, all endeavours
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:40849:85"/> of ours, muſt have this principally heeded, that ſimplicity, integrity, and true ſincerity do truly qualifie whatever of this kind be attempted, which directs us as wel that al the <hi>ingredients</hi> be unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and anſwerable to the pure ſtandard without hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie; as alſo that there be nothing admitted, which is of a forreign allay, which will prove of a corrupting nature to all the reſt. We read that in the <hi>Levitical adminiſtration,</hi> there was both an holy Oyntment, and an holy Perfume, for the ſpecial uſe of the Tabernacle, to be compounded by ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial direction, according to the Art of the Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30.23, 24, 25, 34, 35, 36. The Spices, Doſe, Confection, and Application of it muſt be ſtrictly ordered by the ſtandard of the Sanctuary, under penalty of death on the leaſt corruption or deviation: The which pointing unto Goſpel-things, I might ſhew particularly, requires all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of care, that what we bring before the Lord for a ſweet ſavour, do fully anſwer the pattern for ſimplicity and godly ſincerity; a little evil elſe, will ſpoyl much good; <hi>Dead Flyes</hi> (ſaith the Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 10.1.) <hi>cauſe the Oyntment of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary to ſend forth a ſtinking ſavour; ſo doth a little Folly him that is in repute for Wiſdom and Honour.</hi> They have need of clean hands, and a pure heart, that doth approach with ſuch intendments. <hi>What manner of perſons ought they to be in all holy Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Godlineſs?

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2dly. What we bring on this deſign, muſt bear proportion to hers in this, Her <hi>Spicknard</hi> was <hi>very precious.</hi> Which expreſſion ſignifieth as well the inward vertue and excellency of it, as the rich
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:40849:86"/> price, coſt and value of it. <hi>It might</hi> (ſaid the Diſciples) <hi>have been ſold</hi> (and ſuch things ſeldom yield what they coſt) <hi>for three hundred pence;</hi> which likely was the Roman penny, by computation about ſeven pence half-penny of ours, that amounts to about 9<hi>l.</hi> — 7<hi>s.</hi>—6<hi>d. ſterlin.</hi> So great a value to be expended at one daſh on Chriſt, by a Woman; that ſeems to have been not one of the richeſt nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; being ſo highly commended, and propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as an exemplary inſtance to us, ſhews that what we bring of this kind, muſt be in the ſight of God of <hi>great price</hi> (as a gracious frame of Spirit in his children is ſaid to be) even that <hi>hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.4. In this alſo it is ſignificant, that the external coſt and detriment, that ſuch vigorous attempts may bring upon us, ought not to be drawn into the reckoning, as worthy to be named or counted dear to our ſelves, ſo we may bring him Honour, bear up his Name, ſerve our Generation, finiſh our Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and hereby raiſe him a ſweet ſavour in the midſt of an adulterous age, where we are brought forth. The debate and reſolution between two generous ſpirits (<hi>David</hi> and <hi>Araunah</hi>) about offering up a ſweet ſavour to the Lord, is very teaching, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.24. <hi>I will ſurely buy it of thee for a price; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will I offer burnt offerings unto the Lord my God of that which doth coſt me nothing.</hi> Such as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs a perſwaſion of the neceſſity toward this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, of a rich acceſs of the precious things of Heaven, ſuch as precious Bloud (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19.) of a precious Chriſt (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.7.) apprehended by precious Faith (2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.1.) through precious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes (<hi>verſ.</hi> 4.) in a precious Word (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.1.)
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:40849:86"/> anſwering to thoſe precious things of Heaven, &amp;c. <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.13. to 16. Such I ſay as acknowledge a neceſſity of theſe, are much overſeen, to ſtick at, and ſtand upon things of a lower value, ſuch as, Father, Mother, Wife, Children, Brethren, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, own Life, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.26, to 33. <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.37, 38, 39. <hi>Mark</hi> 10.28, 29, 30. as though they were too coſtly or precious to be laid down upon this honourable account, <hi>if the Lord have need of them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3dly. The Oyntment ſhe brought, is in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect teaching to us, That the Application of it was very <hi>Manifeſt, Liberal,</hi> and <hi>Diffuſive;</hi> She did not only open, pierce, and give ſome vent to it ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly and gradually, but <hi>brake the Box, pouring it out upon his head.</hi> It beſpeaks the buſineſs perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſuch good will, ſo throughly and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, as intended neither ſecreſie nor reſervation, as his head and all his other parts were filled with the Oyntment (anſwering that Scripture, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 133.2.) ſo was the whole houſe intentionally filled with odour of it, <hi>John</hi> 12.3. — Chriſt is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally honoured with our affairs of this kind, when we appear moſt openly and communicatively in ſending forth the ſavour, and ſhewing forth the vertues of him that hath called us out of darkneſs into his marvellous Light, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. The excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of this compoſition is beſt diſcerned, in its conteſt with, and conqueſt over oppoſition, then ſmelling moſt, when cenſured, cruſhed, bruiſed moſt; holding forth the Word of Life as Lights in the World, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.15, 16. to make all men ſee what is the fellowſhip of the Myſtery, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.9. We only then anſwer the ends and expectation of
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:40849:87"/> Chriſt, now preſſed after, when (though in cenſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perilous dayes) we do in our ſeveral places and capacities, <hi>do what we can,</hi> by a publick Teſtimony, bear witneſs to every Truth and Vertue of his, and ſuch eſpecially as are moſt eminently ſtriven againſt, by the wickedneſs of the dayes and places we live in.</p>
                  <p>We come now to ſpeak to the ſpecial Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents of the <hi>Confection</hi> which is only competent to preſerve a ſweet ſavour to Chriſt's dying Intereſt, about which, for the encouragement and direction of the meaneſt Saint, to <hi>do what they can,</hi> this muſt be conſidered, <hi>That all of them that are a ſweet ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour unto God, they are the Spices and Powders of the Merchants, Cant.</hi> 6.1. <hi>Mark.</hi> 16.1. <hi>brought from far,</hi> and to be bought at Goſpel-prices, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.18. <hi>I counſel thee to buy of me, &amp;c.</hi> That which is of our own growth, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8, 9. begged or borrowed, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.9. will not ſerve the turn. This, though very precious, yet they that have a mind to trade in it, may have great penyworths, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.1, 2, 3. Nor is it the leſs acceptable to the Lord, or thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, that they bring it with this acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.14, 15, 16. <hi>What am I, and what is this people, that we ſhould be able to offer ſo willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? For all things come of thee, and of thine own have we given thee; all this ſtore that we have prepared cometh of thy hand, and all is thine own.</hi> — More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, this ſhould be an encouragement to the poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, weakeſt Believer, That though ſpiritual gifts of deep knowledge and utterance, may do much towards the raiſing, and repute, to a dying cauſe; Yet have the graces of the Spirit, ſhining in the hearts and converſation of a poor Believer, an
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:40849:87"/> eſtimation of a greater price in the ſight of God, and a real and direct tendency to glorifie the Name of God in a ſtanding way, when the high and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned gifts of Propheſie may fail, and Tongues ceaſe, and Knowledge vaniſh away, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. to the end. The truth of which we have verified in our dayes, and may yet further, That the great, lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, famed men, who would be thought the only Bulwarks and Champions for the Truth and Cauſe, have ſhrunk from it, and their Names rot and ſtunk, whileſt a few poor deſpiſed Saints that own themſelves nothing, and have no might, have yet been preſerved, to abide with Chriſt in his tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and having obtained a little ſtrength, do not deny his Name. Thus hath it been in all Ages, <hi>Not many Wiſe, &amp;c.</hi> But <hi>God hath choſen the fooliſh things, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>I thank thee Father, Lord of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>that thou haſt hid theſe things from the wiſe and prudent, and haſt revealed them unto babes; even ſo Father, &amp;c.</hi> But more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In all ſuch <hi>Confections,</hi> there is indeſpenſibly neceſſary, <hi>A lively Faith of the operation of God, without which it is impoſſible to pleaſe him,</hi> Heb. 11.6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.23. This contributes ſtrength, ſavour, and duration to all other ingredients (as they ſay Ambergreeſe doth to all Perfumes) is in the front of all others, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5. And though it be precious (<hi>v.</hi> 1.) yet muſt have vertue ſtill diligently added to it. <hi>By Faith</hi> Joſeph <hi>when he died made mention of the departure of the Children of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>&amp; gave command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment concerning his bones,</hi> Heb. 11.22. Many are the excellent exploits recorded by <hi>Moſes,</hi> performed by <hi>Joſeph's</hi> Faith; yet the Spirit ſingles this one out
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:40849:88"/> doubtleſs for its exemplary eminency) to abide upon this Goſpel-File, that his Faith at dying (though the Light of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were for the time ſeemingly put out with him) had ſuch a ſingular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the aſſurance of the Promiſe of deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, that on the ſingle evidence thereof he gave commandment touching his bones. What Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment? namely, the ſame he had given touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Fathers bones, <hi>Gen.</hi> 50.2. That <hi>they ſhould be embalmed,</hi> the better to comport and be in fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with the deſign of the Promiſe, in the truth of which he had ſo much confidence, as he was contented his bones ſhould be kept (though imbalmed) above ground, and not repoſed to their proper reſt, till his people alſo ſhould be brought to reſt in the Land of Promiſe; his Faith prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a Cave in <hi>Canaan,</hi> before a Pyramid in <hi>Egypt;</hi> and would be preſerved by an <hi>embalming,</hi> wherein Faith had the principal hand, <hi>Gen.</hi> 50.24, 25, 26. <hi>Jacobs</hi> bones muſt alſo be embalmed upon the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of that precious Promiſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 46.4. <hi>I will go down with thee into</hi> Egypt, <hi>and I will ſurely bring thee up again. Jacobs</hi> bones muſt be brought ſweet to <hi>Canaan,</hi> to ſhew the precious compliances of Faith with Promiſes, ſeemingly dead and broken to Sence and Reaſon.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>There is neceſſary in ſuch embalming, Love and the fruits of it.</hi> Of theſe two, ſomething was ſpoken above, as being principal agents in doing what we can. This conſtrains the ſoul to do excellent things, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14. beareth, indureth, acteth, layeth out unſpeakably, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.7, 8. <hi>Cant.</hi> 8.6, 7. <hi>Work of Faith,</hi> and <hi>labour of Love</hi> are joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.3. thinks it can never do enough
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:40849:88"/> for Chriſt, and for poor ſouls (<hi>chap.</hi> 28.) this cauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth an odour of a <hi>ſweet</hi> ſmell, a ſacrifice <hi>acceptable</hi> and <hi>well-pleaſing</hi> to God, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.8.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A Third Ingredient that admirably accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies the other (as one of the three principal Spices, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30.23.) <hi>is the patience of Hope,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.3. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.13. This is choicely fitted for ſuch a Grave, till ſuch a Reſurrection, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.6, 7. <hi>Job</hi> 14.7, 14. It's of an exceeding ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (1 <hi>John</hi> 3.3.) and comforting tendancy, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.12. It ſweetens a ſtinking priſon, <hi>Zech.</hi> 9.11, 12. <hi>Acts</hi> 28.20. a ſtinking grave, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.9. it maketh not aſhamed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.5. becauſe of the precious love of Chriſt ſhed abroad, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Without <hi>Holineſs</hi> there can be no ſuch ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as is preſſed after, <hi>Thou wilt not ſuffer thy holy One to ſee corruption.</hi> Saintſhip both in its truth, and manifeſtation, is indiſpenſibly required hereunto; <hi>A cleanſing our ſelves by the power of Promiſes from all filthineſs both of fleſh and ſpirit, perfecting holineſs in fear of God.</hi> To ſpeak properly, <hi>Holineſs</hi> is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of all the Graces of a Saint in a joynt concurrence; and is the very complexion of the new-creature, as Holineſs is the Nature of God, and reſpects all his glorious attributes, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. In propoſing this therefore, I ſpeak the whole of a Chriſtians Concerns in this buſineſs, <hi>Be ye clean who bear the veſſels of the Lord.</hi> Under this then is intended all the fruits of the Spirit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerated, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22, 23. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5, 6, 7, 8. and elſewhere plentifully deſcribed, and exhorted to.—</p>
                  <p n="5">5. I ſhall therefore only add, <hi>That a ſpirit of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and Zeal for God, not liable to be proſtituted to
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:40849:89"/> the love or fear of creatures, is moſt eminently requiſite to compleat a ſweet ſavour to the ſcorned things of Chriſt.</hi> A ſhrinking private low ſpirit, very much diſhonours ſo great a Leader and Commander, as Chriſt hath been unto us; A moſt lively example is in the caſe before us, — Theſe poor Women were ſo far carried above their fears, that in the face of danger in a time of fears, though in the morning while it was yet dark, they made their approaches to the Sepulchre to perfume it, though it might be judged both unſeaſonable, uncivil, and unſafe for Women to come ſo near an armed Guard (eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if Souldiers were then as they are now) ſet on purpoſe, to prevent the conſequences of ſuch twylight approaches, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.63, 64, 65, 66. And let looſe to all manner of incivilities without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul, <hi>chap.</hi> 27.27. to 31. Such a Spirit becomes us; not aſhamed, not afraid of the Teſtimony of our Lord, nor of his Priſoners, but ready to be offered up, as partakers of the Afflictions of the Goſpel according to the power of God: <hi>For we have not received the ſpirit of Fear, but of Power, of Love, and of a ſound mind,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.7, 8.</p>
                  <p>Theſe vertues of Jeſus Chriſt in their conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, fixation, and exerciſe, in the ſpirit and walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Saints, are the Oyntments and Ornaments in the ſight of God and Men of great price; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould the weakeſt Saint be diſcouraged, to bring forth what they have of this kind, to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon deſign; and treaſury Chriſt puts a value on it, and then we ſhould not hold back more than is meet. Which leads me to the <hi>Fourth general Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration</hi> propounded for opening the main <hi>Doctrine,</hi> namely, —</p>
                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:40849:89"/>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>How are we to conceive of Chriſt's Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of what is done of this kind by us?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We ſee the Text ſpeaks it, directly, and fully in the caſe of this cenſured, hard-thought-of poor Woman; and if we can find the diſpoſition and temper of his heart to be the ſame in our caſe, it may prove a great encouragement and engagement to <hi>do what we can for Christ, whether men be pleaſed or diſpleaſed at it:</hi> All I ſhall do here, is to ſhew (1) That Chriſt accepts kindly and well pleaſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſuch offers to raiſe a ſweet ſavour. And then (2) How he ſignifies this his Acceptance.</p>
                  <p>Of the former, take but one teſtimony, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.12, to 16. <hi>Thy Plants</hi> (ſaith Chriſt to his Church) <hi>are an Orchard of Pomegranates with pleaſant fruits, Camphire with Spikenard, and Saffron, Calamus, and Cinamom, with all trees of Frankincenſe, Myrrhe, and Aloes, with all the chief Spices, &amp;c. Awake, O North Wind, and blow O South, that the Spices thereof may flow out.</hi> That by thoſe ſeveral ſweet-ſmelling Spices, are intended the Graces of the Spirit, I think is ordinarily concluded. The ſcope of this Scripture, is to draw forth the ſmell of theſe upon the conſideration of the value that Chriſt puts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and the acceptation he hath of them, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven then when poor ſouls are under ſome ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Providences, too much incloſed, ſhut up and ſealed; To prevent which privateneſs of ſpirit, and to draw forth this fragrant perfume to more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, the North-wind, and South-wind, are called to meet, in their oppoſition, upon the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; ſignifying, perhaps, that commotion and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet ſtate of things, where ſuch contrary blaſts have their violent conteſts, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.2. by means
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:40849:90"/> whereof, though the Garden may ſeem to ſuffe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ſome ſpoyl and loſs, yet it's to the heart of Chriſt, that his Spicknard, and other Plants, through theſe bruiſings and ſhakings, ſhould ſend forth the ſmell thereof: However this ſeems evident, That what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever private, low, and undervaluing thoughts the poor Saints have of their own attainments, becauſe they are but Plants yet, not tall Trees, as the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dars of <hi>Labanon</hi> that God hath planted; yet Chriſt hath his eye upon their ſpiritual Nature and Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, they are all Slips of that Branch of Renown, are ſweeter and more acceptable in his account, than (through their humility) they ſeem to be in theirs; we yet know not the high value he puts upon the riches of the glory of the inheritance in the Saints, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.18. and to have them in exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, eſpecially on ſo ſolemn occaſion as this is; why it is the joy and rejoycing of his heart. The heart of Chriſt in point of this acceptance may be read in <hi>Davids</hi> on an occaſion, which hath ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance, at leaſt might be uſed to illuſtrate this, and that is, in his expreſſing himſelf thankfully to the men of <hi>Jabeſh-Gilead,</hi> for the Funeral-love they had ſhewed to one, who had been the Lords Anointed, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.5, 6. <hi>Bleſſed be ye of the Lord, that you have ſhewed this kindneſs to your Lord, even unto</hi> Saul, <hi>and have buried him; and now the Lord ſhew kindneſs and truth unto you; and I alſo will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite your kindneſs becauſe ye have done this thing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The bleſſing he gives them, ſhews his accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to the uttermoſt, the occaſion thus; There was a day when the men of <hi>Jabeſh-Gilead,</hi> were in unſpeakable diſtreſs by means of the hard terms offered them by <hi>Nahaſh</hi> the <hi>Ammonite,</hi> 1 Sam. 11.
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:40849:90"/> 1, 2. they could have their peace upon no other terms than by eſpouſing an irreparable mark of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach and infamy on themſelves, and all <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and in this nick of extremity, <hi>Saul</hi> puts his life in his hand, and reſcues them ſeaſonably, and wrought a very great deliverance. This kindneſs of <hi>Saul</hi> to them, they were never in a capacity to requite, till the day that the body of their Lord, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental Saviour, was hanged on the Wall of a Gariſon of the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> as a mark of like re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach and ignominy on the whole Intereſt of God. In ſuch a day of death and danger, when the body of their Lord, and his dear Children, is hung a ſtinking in the face of the Sun; now is a time to prove and improve the kindneſs, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity of their ſpirits toward their Lord and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> by putting their lives in their hands, and doing what they could to fetch him off from, and give a check to that reproach of the enemies of the Lord on his Name and Intereſt. They attempt it, they ſucceed, and bring off theſe dead bodies, and (mark it) <hi>they came to</hi> Jabeſh <hi>and burnt them there, and took their bones and buried them, and faſted ſeven dayes,</hi> 1 Sam. 31.11, 12, 13. They not only <hi>buried,</hi> but <hi>burnt them there,</hi> which was the manner of Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Funerals: compare it with 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.14. <hi>They laid</hi> Aſa <hi>in a bed which was filled with ſweet odours, and divers kind of ſpices, prepared by the Apothecaries art, and they made a very great burning for him:</hi> See <hi>Jer.</hi> 34.5. <hi>With the burnings of thy Fathers, the former Kings which were before thee, ſo ſhall they burn odours for thee.</hi> This perfumed Royal Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral you ſee hath acceptance and recompence with <hi>David.</hi> And ſhall Jeſus Chriſt, who laid down his
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:40849:91"/> life to take away the curſe and reproach from us, and hath ſet us free from wrath to come (which we can never requite) now call for a proof of our kindneſs, and thankfulneſs, by doing what we can to reſcue the honour of his Name and Intereſt that is now expoſed to contempt, and to beſtow a more perfuming funeral on it, and lamentation over it, than without danger we durſt do; and ſhall we ſtand upon the hazard and coſt of it, and in ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhall not we loſe the bleſſing of <hi>David, The Lord ſhew kindneſs and truth unto you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nay, ſhall not the men of <hi>Jabeſh-Gilead</hi> riſe up in judgement, who did what they could to cover the ſhame, and recover the honour of a wicked Prince, who fell for his iniquity, as if he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been anointed; and ſhall we refuſe, or come ſhort of perfuming this ſervice to the King of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, who is put to an open ſhame in his Name and People; God forbid. —This honourable act will find acceptable reſentment and recompence from Chriſt as that did from <hi>David,</hi> and as kindneſs to the dead hath alwayes done on ingenious ſpirits: <hi>Ruth</hi> 1.8. &amp; 2.20. <hi>Bleſſed be he of the Lord, who hath not left off his kindneſs to the living and the dead.</hi> But let us ſee how Chriſt doth manifeſt this his acceptance of ſuch attempts.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Chriſt is ready to ſhew forth his acceptance of this kindneſs, by his being ſo willingly ingaged to plead the cauſe, and vindicate the innocency and integrity of ſuch a People as do what they can for him; many are the ill inſtructions at home, and the ignominies abroad that will be raiſed upon ſuch an account; But of this we may have aſſurance, he ſtands ingaged to make good that word,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:40849:91"/> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.30. <hi>Them that honour me, I will honour; and they that deſpiſe me, ſhall be lightly eſteemed.</hi> As Chriſt ſtood not upon his own vindication, when his Father's honour was in his eye; but he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted his cauſe to him, who effectually hath brought it about; So ſhould not we ſtand upon our own vindication, when the Name of Chriſt lies at the ſtake. See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 35.5, 6. <hi>Commit thy way to the Lord, &amp;c. And he ſhall bring forth thy Righteouſneſs as the light, and thy Judgement as the noon-day.</hi> We ſee how effectual he doth it in the Text, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this poor Woman in all her ignominies, and hard ſpeeches that ſhe met withal; and no leſs will he ſhew it at this day, to be the high title of his honour, <hi>Thus ſaith thy Lord, the Lord, and thy God, who pleadeth the cauſe of his people,</hi> Iſa. 51.22. <hi>He will thorowly plead their cauſe,</hi> Jer. 50.34. <hi>and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute Judgement for them, bring them forth to the light, and their eyes ſhall behold thy Righteouſneſs, Micah</hi> 7.9. Marvellous have been the Lord's wayes and methods of aſſerting the integrity of his people, from the midſt of the clouds of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miny.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Chriſt ſheweth his acceptance by ordering the iſſues of all the proviſion that a people makes for his Name and Glory, that it proves the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recteſt proviſion they can poſſible make for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their beſt intereſt, <hi>The liberal man devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth liberal things, and by liberal things ſhall he ſtand,</hi> Iſa. 32.8. That courſe w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> the generality of people conclude according to rules of Providence is the way to ruine them, proves the moſt effectual means to eſtabliſh them: of this <hi>Pſal.</hi> 112. gives a full teſtimony. The good man, is there brought in
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:40849:92"/> 
                     <hi>gracious, full of compaſſion, ſhewing favour, and lend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, diſperſing, giving to the Poor;</hi> and yet in all reſpects, making the fulleſt proviſion for his own beſt bleſſedneſs in ſo doing. That of Chriſt is the Paradox to prudent Profeſſors in perilous times, which they can by no means reſolve, <hi>He that will ſave his life ſhall loſe it, and he that will loſe his life ſhall ſave it.</hi> How evidently is this made good in the good Name of perſons? Men have generally reaſoned, that to cleave to ſuch a Profeſſion, or Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, or People, hath been the high-way to be diſgraced for ever; whereas the Lord hath mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly built up the Houſes of ſuch (as its ſaid of the <hi>Midwives</hi> Houſes in <hi>Egypt.</hi>) We reade in the firſt and laſt <hi>verſes</hi> ſave one of <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. concerning the Worthies, That <hi>by Faith they obtained a good report, though they received not the Promiſe.</hi> It was mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of reproach to them, that they ſhould imbrace and cleave to certain Promiſes from generation to generation, owning them as their Intereſt, which yet brought not forth in their day, the great things they teſtified of, and profeſſed that as Pilgrimes and Strangers they waited for; they made this their buſineſs, to raiſe a good report, and preſerve a ſweet ſavour upon the Promiſes, which yet brought not forth as they expected they ſhould; but yet this they got by it, the Promiſes left a good report on them, <hi>Their Names</hi> (by means thereof) <hi>were as precious Oyntment,</hi> Eccleſ. 7.1. for that their converſation were as precious Oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Name of God. —</p>
                  <p>Chriſt ſhews his acceptance of ſuch, by making known to ſuch the moſt early diſcoveries of his further breaking forth of Glory beyond any other.
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:40849:92"/> So it was in the caſe of the Text, they that were at this early coſtly proviſion of Imbalm, had the firſt Knowledg, Evidence, and Joy of the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Chriſt from the dead; and muſt be the firſt meſſengers of the bleſſed Tydings thereof, <hi>John</hi> 20.1, 14. to 18. <hi>Luke</hi> 24.10. <hi>Mark</hi> 16.9, 10. They had not the firſt manifeſtation of it who were men of the greateſt parts, imployment, or eſteem. Nothing is more obvious to frequent experience, then the preventing Grace of Chriſt, at leaſt in keeping the ſpirits of ſuch ſweet, quick, lively; and if any fore-taſtes of approaching Glory be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſuch overcommers ſhall have the morning-ſtar, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.28.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt's acceptance is frequently ſignified this way; They who do what they can to raiſe a ſweet ſavour on the concerns of Chriſt, ſhall be rendred the moſt uſeful, bleſſed, and a bleſſing of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in their generations; <hi>The bleſſings of the ſouls and bodies of them that were ready to periſh ſhall come upon ſuch,</hi> Job. 29.13. <hi>They ſhall be as dew frow the Lord, and as the ſhowers upon the graſs, that tarrieth not for man, nor waiteth for the ſons of men,</hi> Micah. 5.7. Their love to <hi>Christ,</hi> laying out its ſelf for him thus, is likened to the Oyntment on the head of <hi>Aaron,</hi> and the dew of <hi>Hermon</hi> and <hi>Sion;</hi> for there the Lord commanded the bleſſing, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 133. The Families, Neighbours, Fellow-members of ſuch ſhall riſe and call ſuch bleſſed, <hi>Prov.</hi> 31.28. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34.26. The diſtinguiſhing mark of acceptation is reſerved by <hi>Christ,</hi> till the day of recompence, which haſtneth greatly, in the w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> not the value of a cup of cold water hath been given on this ſweetning deſign, but ſhall have its eminent reward. Upon
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:40849:93"/> that enquiry of the poor Diſciples, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.27. <hi>Behold, we have forſaken [All] and have followed thee, what ſhall we have therefore?</hi> It was a great [All] a few Fiſhing-Nets and Boats, and the like poor things; Yea, but it was their [All] they had done, and were undone, as far as they could for <hi>Christ;</hi> and what remaineth to them? Truly they having followed <hi>Christ</hi> in the Regeneration (or as <hi>Luke</hi> 22.28.) continued with him in his Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he appoints to them a Kingdom as the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther appointed him, <hi>They must eat and drink with him in his Kingdom, ſitting on Thrones and judging the Tribes of</hi> Iſrael; <hi>and every one that hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken Brothers, or Houſes, or Fathers, &amp;c. ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive an hundred fold, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From the words, a few things more tending to a cloſer Application of the whole, ſhall ſerve for a cloſe.</p>

This might be improved by way of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation thus; If <hi>Christ</hi> do put ſuch a real high value upon all attempts that are levelled toward this deſign, to preſerve a ſweet ſavour on his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, when they are by the world expoſed to ſtinking. Then</p>
                  <p n="1">1. May we gather how the heart of <hi>Christ</hi> ſtands aſpecting ſuch as do what they can to render him and the things of his Name and Glory odious, by laying contempt and reproach upon it what in them lyeth; ſurely it will be a bad day for ſuch when he ſhall plead with them, and vindicate the quarrel of his abuſed Name and Intereſt: If they that honour him ſhall be thus honoured, then they who deſpiſe him ſhall be lightly eſteemed, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.20. It's worth conſideration, what requitals

                     <hi>Uſe</hi> 2. But I rather proceed to offer a few things, that may tend to direct and ingage in this matter. And here (firſt) ſome <hi>Cautions</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent miſtakes and miſcarriages, in the Preparation and Application of this Imbalm; and (then) a few <hi>Directions,</hi> and I ſhall conclude.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Caution</hi> 1. Take heed that you continue not in ſuch a ſtate, and carry ſuch corruption about you, as will render you utterly incapable of doing any other than raiſing a ſtench on the things of <hi>Christ.</hi> Whatever you have to do about them, the purity of this Confection is ſuch as the leaſt evil owned and allowed, will diffuſe its malignity through it to the vitiating the whole, and rendring it of none
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:40849:94"/> effect: A little ſuch leaven will ſowre the whole lump; <hi>Dead Flyes cauſe the Oyntment of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary to ſtink, ſo doth a little folly, &amp;c.</hi> This is notably illuſtrated in the caſe put, <hi>Hagg.</hi> 2.11, 14. where is ſhewed that there is much more force and malignity in a little evil to corrupt much good, then there is in much Religious Service of ſuch a People, to leave an impreſſion of goodneſs on things otherwiſe void of it. Look to it that you be very clean who bear the veſſels of the Lord in this Service, leſt you defile this undertaking for the Lord: clean hands and a pure heart are indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly requiſites in this affair.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Caution</hi> 2. Take heed according to what Rules, Inſtructions, or Diſpenſatory you compound this Imbalm. I hinted before how exactly careful God was in the Compoſition both of the Oyl and Pouder that were to perfume his Tabernacle, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30.23, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> No leſs is he jealous of the preſent things under conſideration, Take we heed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of falſe Rules, and Principles, as name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Take heed how you admit of humane Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Prudence, the conſultings of fleſh and blood, to dictate and give rules in theſe matters. It is very fruitful in multiplying inventions, eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, expedients, diſtinctions, which indeed have a ſhew of Wiſdom, but its frequent that the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents ſubtilty is foiſted in, in the place of the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of <hi>Christ;</hi> to call any man <hi>Maſter</hi> in this matter, is very dangerous.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Take heed you miſtake not by ſeeking the <hi>Cheapest</hi> inſtead of the <hi>Chiefest</hi> way of this Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuming. It's indeed our wiſdom and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:40849:95"/> to ſet down afore-hand and caſt the coſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.28, 31, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> leſt having begun, you be not able to finiſh; but then it muſt be brought to this iſſue, <hi>verſ.</hi> 33. <hi>Whoſoever he be that forſaketh not all that ever he hath, he cannot be my Diſciple.</hi> Nothing leſs than all one hath, even his whole Living, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing on this ſide Heaven muſt be made up in the account <hi>(if the Lord hath need of it)</hi> to be laid out on it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Caution</hi> 3. Admit not Cuſtome, common Fame, nor common Fear to be your Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours: Theſe and the like <hi>Cautions</hi> muſt be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued.</p>
                  <p>But I had rather Conclude with a few <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. If you do any thing excellent for Chriſt, do it early: So did this good Woman, both in the Text and at the Sepulchre. Many ſtay their hands from works of this kind, till they ſee what others, who are accounted more eminent, will do; they think it imprudent, and to ſavour of raſhneſs and ſingularity to be preſidential and exemplary: but this will one day be found the excellency of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian activity in works of this nature, <hi>That they tarry not for men, nor wait for the ſons of men,</hi> Micha 5.7. We may in this caſe allude to that paſſage, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.12. <hi>Ye are my Brethren, ye are my Bone and my Fleſh, wherefore are ye then the laſt to bring back the King?</hi> Many are ſo late and lingring in works that concern Chriſt's Glory of this kind, putting it off from one time to another, till their ſpirits ſink to the work, and the things themſelves (as was ſaid of <hi>Lazarus</hi>) ſtink in their noſtrils.</p>

He that (as was ſaid) was judged by the Wiſe men of the Eaſt worthy of a preſent of Frankincenſe, Gold, and Myrrhe at his birth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing born King of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> and of a coſtly bed of Spices by honourable counſel at his funeral, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Crucified as King of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> deſerves upon the ſame account an honourable treatment, when any of his things come under clouds and ſuſpition by the men of the times. Some Kings indeed were ſo evil, as debarred them from Royal Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, <hi>Jer.</hi> 22.18, 19. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21.19, 20. But <hi>Christ</hi> deſerves better uſuage.

                  <p>

<pb n="176" facs="tcp:40849:99"/> ſake; and I beſeech you continue ſtedfaſt in the Faith and Teſtimony to Christ and his Concerns, who is as worthy as ever, notwithſtanding all the reproach cast on him and them; and I deſire earneſtly you will take heed of being offended at Him, his Word, Works, or Wayes, but be careful to be found in his paths, as ever you hope to have help, to ſtand before him with peace and comfort at his appearing.</p>

                     <hi>He further ſaid,</hi> Christ had a poor Remnant yet left, that he was perſwaded ſhould be helped to ſtand, and no more to be afraid of the worst that men can do, than he, through Grace, was now afraid of what Death could do to him. <hi>And ſaid,</hi> Though I may be rolled into my dust, yet there is a promiſed approaching Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that God will moſt certainly bring forth out of all theſe great deeps, with which we are now encompaſt, though <hi>(ſaies he)</hi> it may be you alſo may not live to ſee it, but to die in the Faith of it will be enough; and the Lord grant you may not ſtagger, and that no cloud may be upon your Teſtimony to God, nor (unleſs clouds be good for you) upon your Interest in him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And as to the Church at</hi> Plymouth, <hi>he ſaid,</hi> He had oft, ſince his Sickneſs, on his bed, begg'd of God, that the Lord the God of the ſpirits of all fleſh, would ſet a man over that Church, a man whom he ſhould chuſe, to go in and out before them, to feed them, that ſo the Lords poor flock be not utterly ſcattered by thoſe that carry or keep them Captive. <hi>Numb. 27. he referred to.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>And further ſaid to a Friend then preſent,</hi> I deſire you, if God by his Providence or otherwiſe, ſhall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after ſpeak any ſuch thing to you, though but in a whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, you would not deſpiſe or neglect it, but look on it as the Call of God to you, and obey it accordingly.</p>

                     <hi>To which that Friend replyed, My weakneſs is ſufficiently known to you, my ſelf, and others, for ſuch a weighty ſervice, making me dread the thoughts of ſuch an undertaking as at preſent furniſht; yet I hope I ſhall carefully mind, what the Lord may ſpeak to me in future, as alſo what hint you have now given about it, to do therein as God ſhall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect.</hi>

                     <hi>One telling him, he ſpent himſelf; he ſaid,</hi> He would gladly ſpend and be ſpent for Chriſt, yet would not make undue haſte to Heaven till his Beloved pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet I would bid my Friends Farewel, remembring <hi>Elijah</hi> threw his Mantle on <hi>Eliſha</hi> at parting; and though I cannot yet ſay whether it be finally farewel: <hi>Paul</hi> bid the Romans farewel often, but I can bid you heartily farewel, bleſſedly farewel. <hi>Then added,</hi> I have one word for <hi>Sion,</hi> I have been oft refreſht in thoughts of old <hi>Jacob,</hi> as I mentioned but now, how he revived, and ſaid, Joſeph <hi>is yet alive, I will go down and ſee him before I die:</hi> But yet before he comes out of <hi>Canaan</hi> he is at a ſtand, and God must be ſought to know his mind, <hi>Gen. 46.4.</hi> God aſſures him, he would go with him into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and would ſurely bring him up thence, and yet <hi>Jacob</hi> muſt die there; I have thought how can this word be true? and have been anſwered, it was true to <hi>Jacob</hi> collectively, though not perſonally conſidered, his ſeed, and with them him alſo, dead or alive, muſt be brought up with them in the time appointed; and though <hi>Jacob's</hi> life indeed is took off in ſomewhat an unexpected time and way, yet his Faith is kept up ſo as he gives charge in that matter, ere he dies, that his bones ſhould be carried up with them, and ſo gives teſtimony to the Truth of God in that caſe, and the like doth <hi>Joſeph.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Oh Friend! God hath brought us down unto <hi>Egypt,</hi> it may be where we would not have gone; he hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed let us go in the beginning of our way where we would, and we then went under full gales like to them, <hi>Exod. 15.14.</hi> to <hi>18.</hi> ſaying, We ſhall come up out of

                     <hi>Egypt,</hi> it may be pitching it too perſonally as to us, for whether we in our perſons ſhall be brought from <hi>Baſhan</hi> and the depths of the Sea, may yet be a queſtion; but if we be indeed the ſeed of <hi>Jacob,</hi> that ſeek him and his face, we ſhall then most certainly be brought up dead, or alive, out of <hi>Egypt:</hi> let's endeavour to keep up Faith in that.</p>
                  <p>There is a <hi>Cauſe</hi> God hath ſtretched out his hand to own amongst us, though men may be divided about it what it is; ſome ſay it conſiſts in Stating and Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our Rights againſt Oppreſſours; but I take it to be ſuch a Teſtimony to Chriſt's Kingdom, that few will eſpouſe but ſuch as love the Lord Jeſus in ſincerity. Though as to <hi>out-works,</hi> they muſt be owned as works of wonder, but the <hi>inward-part</hi> is the main thing, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to bring forth Judgement and Truth into Power and Practice, ſo as all the upright in heart ſhall follow it; this, even this ſhall be ſo brought out and lifted up over the heads of all oppoſitions and oppreſſors; but God hath much of this kind yet to bring forth in the hearts of his own Children: <hi>But, Lord, what wait I for? my hope is in thee.</hi>

O Lord, by theſe things men live; and in all theſe things is the life of my ſpirit, ſo wilt thou recover me, and make me to live. So I have a word or hint ſometimes as if the Lord would ſay,</hi> Eat a little, and drink a little; <hi>as if he might have ſome little further work for me; but then old pains, and not old clearneſs again at other ſeaſons, making me ſee and ſay, Oh! how hard a thing is it to keep an even hand with God, in his various diſpenſations. So</hi> fooliſh was I and ignorant, as that good man once ſaid, <hi>Pſal. 37.</hi> Sometimes as a man, then as a Beast, &amp;c. but 'tis good for me to draw near unto God, and to ſay though he kill me, yet I will trust in him.</p>
                  <q>But it pleaſed the Lord though by very undiſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able degrees, after keeping his Chamber three quarters of a year, to give him a Recovery for ſome ſeaſon; after which being ſeized with Sickneſs, which continued to the finiſhing of his dayes; the following, being but few of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny worthy occaſional ſayings of his, were by the ſame Friend carefully treaſured up.</q>

<pb n="183" facs="tcp:40849:102"/> to you my dear Friends, as an Argument for ever to truſt in God.</p>
                  <p>There is alſo, ſome thing I have been under from his own hand, that hath been with great pain upon me, as you have been Witneſſes; and my ſorrows here have been oft-times greater than my groanings, and this laſt hath been well nigh overſetting at ſome ſeaſons, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as I thought it was impoſſible to have born the torments laid on my poor fleſh; but now I ſee nothing is too hard for God, ſometimes to lay on his own Children, or for his Power to bear them up under.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>His Siſter tells him, You ſpend your ſelf in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: He anſwers,</hi> Let me ſpeak that I may be refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It is refreſhing to me to ſpeak of what God hath made ſweet to me. <hi>Then he calls for a little Julip to drink; a Friend ſayes to him, It will be hut a little while, and you will thirſt no more. He replyes,</hi> Ah bleſſed are they that eat Bread in the Kingdom of our Lord, and drink Wines there, he will lead them by Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and Fountains of Living waters, where they ſhall thirſt no more, and he will wipe away all tears from their eyes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>His Siſter deſired to know how he was ſatisfied as to his coming hither, ſhe having been the occaſion as ſhe judged of his coming from</hi> Exon <hi>to</hi> Plymouth, <hi>and conſequently of his coming hither; He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,</hi> Very well ſatisfied, all have been ſteps of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine ordering; I would not have come from <hi>Exon,</hi> might I have had my own will; I would not have ſtayed in <hi>Plymouth,</hi> after I had Preached once, but God would have me ſtay; I would not have come to this place, after my time of ſuffering was out in the <hi>Town-Hall</hi> at <hi>Plymouth,</hi> if I might have had my own will; but God would bring me hither, and bleſſed be the Lord
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:40849:103"/> that let me not have my own will, bleſſed be God that brought me here, and bleſt me here, with deſirable Company and Mercies, concerning which we have had occaſions and ſeaſons to ſpeak well of God together; yea, ſince I have been brought here, and ſick here, yet the ſteps of God have been in great wiſdom with me, and the bottom of them all paved with Love, in the main of his goings in theſe dark and heavy ſtroakes; <hi>I ſay,</hi> in the main of them they have been attended with peace to my ſoul; I have had Old Wine, or New, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded ſtill; ſometimes he hath ſaid the Old is better, and hath made ancient experiences of his Love, ſweet to me, yet not alwayes alike clear; ſometimes he hath ſeen good to cut ſhort within and without, and this laſt tryal, to deal plainly, came on in ſomewhat a cloud, at its entrance I was ſomewhat ſtupid, thinking no more in it than ordinary; but I was at laſt awakened by the Lord to think that this might be a long and cloſe tryal, and though he let me ſee the Anchor dropt within the Vail, yet had I not that freſhneſs of Evidence, till within a few dayes laſt paſt, when he called up my Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to a cloſe ſearch, in a Night or two, though I ſaid but little of it, but he graciouſly iſſued that matter in a token for good, that whether I live or die, I hope I ſhall wear to his praiſe, while I have my being; ſo that thus 'tis with me now, Chriſt is lovely to me in all the afflictions I have met with, in all I have ſeen and ſuffered: wherefore rejoyce with me, O my Friends, let us rejoyce and bleſs the Name of the Lord together that hath dealt well with me; and do not I beſeech you diſgrace the throne of his Glory, becauſe of me or this fleſhly ſtate that muſt be taken from you. Murmur not I pray ye, that yet you ſee not <hi>Saviours</hi> come up upon Mount <hi>Zion.</hi> The reſerve of Spirit is with him, and
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:40849:103"/> the Lord hath many Children to bring in, beſides thoſe that are brought, that ſhall be brought in by vertue of freſh Anointing, ſo as they ſhall be known to be Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of his that he hath bleſt: And as I deſire you would not weep for me, ſo not inordinately for your ſelves neither; adhere to Chriſt, and fear none of thoſe things ye ſhall ſuffer. I have no deep inſight into deep Mysteries; but this <hi>I Believe God is a-riſing</hi> to do ſome great thing in the World for <hi>Sion's ſake,</hi> and though it be hard for us to loſe our Chariots and Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, ſome by Apoſtacy, ſome by Death, ſome by Scattering, yet when the Gathering time ſhall be, it will be no grief, nor ſorrow of heart to behold the way of Gods working in all theſe things, when we ſhall ſay he hath done all things well.</p>
                  <p>There are many ſigns upon us, that prognoſtick great things near at the doors, though I dare not ſay I know much diſtinctly as to Times, Means, and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, only be aſſured not one jot or title of all God hath ſpoke ſhall fail, though our interpretations of them may fail.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If any ask how it ſtood with me, as to theſe things at this ſeaſon, tell them,</hi> If I die, I die in as full Aſſurance that God will give reviving to his poor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed Cauſe and Intereſt, as I do believe the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of this Body, and that I know both the one and the other are founded on ſuch a Word as ſhall ſtand as Mountains of Braſs. And adviſe them alſo, to take heed how they wait on mens Indulgence, ſo much talked of, but let their Faith ſtand in the Wiſdom, Power, and Faithfulneſs of God, and their Prayers be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected more that way, endeavouring to make Religion their buſineſs; yet if any ſhall lean to ſuch a deceitful Bow, be not you diſmayed or diſcouraged at it, but hold
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:40849:104"/> on your way, that ſhall be ſtrength to you.</p>
                  <p>And now, Oh now, could I ſend Epiſtles to all the <hi>Churches;</hi> in theſe things I would, but that work I think is over; be ye therefore as the Epiſtle of that, to them. And now my dear Brother and Siſters, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to bleſs God for you, and for your great tenderneſs to me; but herein, as to particulars, my mouth is ſtopt. I hope you will continue love to my poor Siſter, you ſee what a poor Creature ſhe is, yet I hope one that will find Mercy in the day of Chriſt. And dear Siſter <hi>A. L.</hi> remember me to all Saints in <hi>Plymouth,</hi> and tell them, I have no greater joy than to hear that they are of thoſe Children that are walking in the Truth, as to hear of any of them walking looſe to Chriſt, and looſe to the Profeſſion of him, is my Souls grief. Oh! tell them, that as ever they hope to ſee my face with joy at the great Day, that what they have ſeen and heard from me a poor worm that hath been according to the mind of the Lord, they would do, and the God of Peace ſhall be with them. And now Friends, as a<note n="*" place="margin">

He anſwers,</hi> They had been a kind poor Family, the Lord make them his Family; and, dear Siſter, look over a weak Husband and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and difficulties that may occur as to them and you. You and I have been Witneſſes to the Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt, how he hath provided for us in former dayes; and I challenge you, if you can, to ſay to the contrary, he hath not failed us thus far. <hi>Then he ſaid,</hi> I am weak and faint. <hi>A Friend by, ſaid to him, The Lord the Creator to the ends of the Earth faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

                  <p>
                     <hi>Then ſpeaking to his Siſter</hi> A. <hi>ſaid,</hi> Dear Siſter, Bear up, bear up, bleſſed be God for ſtrength to you thus far, bear up ſtill I beſeech you, accept all in good part, and paſs by all weakneſſes; you and your Husband had Relations each of you, dear to you both; and alſo I truſt to Chriſt, I deſire not complementally, but really to be remembred to them all, and deſire they may be all ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered up to Chriſt to meet him at his appearing.</p>
                  <p>And I deſire for you all that you may be ſtrengthned to all the pleaſure of God, that is yet to come to paſs concerning you, and that you may come out of theſe great Tribulations as Sheep from the waſhing; and though you may ſee me poſſibly go away from you, in the fiery tryal, yet it may be you may be admitted to that Mercy of being bid come out and ſhew your ſelves; yet that is but <hi>little,</hi> conſidering the <hi>ſnares</hi> that may yet attend ſuch a ſtate: But Oh! how much clearer is my way to come out thus, than by men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Then ſpeaking to the</hi> Maid, <hi>he ſaid,</hi> I deſire God may have the praiſe of what he hath wrought in, and for you, and wherever you are caſt, I deſire you may walk as a chaſte Virgin.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And to the</hi> Nurſe <hi>he ſaid,</hi> I know not how you may think your ſelf concerned in ſuch diſcourſe as this, ſince theſe may ſeem ſtrange things to you, yet give me leave to ſay, they are ſome of the true ſayings of God, how
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:40849:105"/> ſtrange ſoever they may ſeem; yea, they are alſo need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful things for you to be acquainted with; Oh preſs af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them with all earneſtneſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Then a Friend preſent, ſpeaking after this manner, Ah! Brother, What is the meaning of theſe Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations of the Lord, in ſnatching away his choiceſt Saints from amongſt us, and leaving the pooreſt and weakeſt to be Concerned for him in ſuch a day, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them ready in ſorrow and ſadneſs of heart to ſay, By whom ſhall</hi> Jacob <hi>ariſe, ſince he is ſo ſmall? To which he replied,</hi> How ſmall ſoever <hi>Jacob</hi> was, yet <hi>Jacob's</hi> God was not ſmall; He is a great King, and a God above all Godds; and as was minded but now, he gives Power to the faint, and our ſtrength is in the Name of the Lord that made Heaven and Earth, who doth and will do much by Babes; wherefore ſay not, I am a Babe, a Child, &amp;c. but rather ſay, Here am I, ſend me, that God who was <hi>Jacob's</hi> God, who fed and led him all his life long, he hath been and is the God of the Seed of <hi>Jacob</hi> to this day, that hath led us thus far alſo, through a vaſt howling Wilderneſs, and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained us, and not ſuffered us to deny his Name: Oh this God is our God, let him be our guide even unto death. The Fathers that were before us, alas, what were they, and the Prophets, do they live for ever? no they were weak as we, and died as muſt we; but when the Lord had work for them to do, he gave Anointing for it, and then they could ſay they were full of Might and Power by the Spirit of the Lord to ſhew <hi>Iſrael</hi> their tranſgreſſion, and the Houſe of <hi>Jacob</hi> their ſin. So we, through Chriſt, can do all things, he ſtrengthning us. Look then to the Lord that gave the former rain, and will give the latter alſo in its ſeaſon, according to his Power. <hi>And my dear Brother,</hi> Be not diſcouraged,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:40849:105"/> your work ſeems cutting ſhort alſo day by day by many things, though what you may live to ſee or ſuffer; I know not, neither do I know how meet it may be to mind you of a motion I made to you about two years ſince on the like occaſion about remembring the poor Flock I have travelled and laboured amongst, if God caſt your lot in theſe parts; but hoping you will mind what may be your Duty in this matter, I ſhall ſay no more, but the Will of the Lord be done; be of good courage, and God ſhall ſtrengthen your hearts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>His Siſter was troubled ſeeing him ſo weak, which occaſioned him to ſay,</hi> Oh! be aſhamed, Siſter, of ſuch a demeanor, cannot you let a poor Believer go to Heaven? Oh! did you but ſtand on the threſhold and ſee what preparations God hath made for ſuch a poor worm as I am, you would never be afraid of Death more. Oh! honour Chriſt much, I think he is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming near to honour me, though I know not yet that my Sentence is come out from him; yet I ſpeak not as if I had hankering thoughts to ſtay. Oh! when ſhall I ſee the day? We ſhall ſing at parting, and not mourn as now; bleſſed be God for ever, that he hath not let the Righteous to be aſhamed, nor Wicked men to triumph over them for my ſake. Ah! did they know what God hath pardoned in me, they might be apt to triumph more than now they can.</p>
                  <p>If there ſeems any importunity from any Friends for any thing to be mentioned of me, when I am gone, ſpeak moderately of me I beſeech you; but if any thing hath been ſeen in me worth learning, let it be offered with much humility; or rather I think let my Works praiſe me in the Gate, but I limit not.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>His Siſter asked, Will you drink?</hi> Yea Siſter <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> Have you any of the beſt ſpiced Wine? <hi>He then grew faint, and could ſpeak no more at that time.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Afterwards, being asked how he did? He ſaid,</hi> All his bones were as it were out of joynt. <hi>And added,</hi> God hath reſerved this Proof of my Miniſtry <hi>(viz.)</hi> in <hi>much painfulneſs</hi> until theſe few years laſt paſt, having been little acquainted with Sickneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. <hi>He then asked</hi> If it were day? <hi>A Friend an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, The night was far ſpent, the day was at hand, even a morning without clouds, to which you ſeem haſtening. To which he replied,</hi> Yes, as a very clear ſhining after rain. <hi>Being asked a while after, How he did? He (with his eyes lifted up) anſwered,</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs I am ſtill with him, he holds my ſoul in life, will guide me by his Counſel, and afterward receive me up to Glory.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A Friend that dwelt upon the place, coming to him, and ſpeaking Religiouſly, He replied,</hi> There was much talk of Religion in the World, but few had attained to acquaintance with the powerful inward part of it; and then minded that much of the power of Religion indeed was comprehended in that word, <hi>Phil. 1.21. For me to live is Chriſt;</hi> not only to live on, or to Chriſt, but to live Chriſt, in all we ſpeak or act is a high work: Lord, let my ſoul <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> into the ſight and joy of it, yet more and more. <hi>The ſame perſon enquiring of him, How it was with him in this hour? He ſaid,</hi> Bleſſed be God, he hath waſhed away my ſins, and ſpoke peace to my ſoul, and thereby obliged me to follow him while I live, and much more to go to him when I die. <hi>Then ſaid,</hi> O Father, ſhall I not now go hence, but return into a world of ſo many ſnares and dangers again. <hi>And further tells the
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:40849:106"/> Perſon aforeſaid, That</hi> he was very ſenſible of great reſpects received from her and her Relation; <hi>And ſaid,</hi> For a full recompence to you all, I deſire when ever you come to ſuch an hour as I am now approaching to, you may meet with the ſame Comforts that through Grace I now find.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A Brother coming from far, a day or two after, to viſit him; being brought in ſuddenly upon him, ſeemed a little diſpleaſed, ſaying,</hi> His Spirit was not now able to bear any ſudden thing without over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetting.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That Brother asking him how he did? He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,</hi> Never better in my life. <hi>But adds,</hi> Think it not to be paſſion or words of diſtraction, for though I am very weak in body, yet God is very near to me.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He alſo then ſaid to a Friend ſitting by, on the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of turning in his bed by reaſon of wearineſs,</hi> Ah! this is not our reſt, it is polluted; but there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains a reſt to the People of the Lord, and his reſt ſhall be glorious.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>After this he had a day or two that ſeemed to be hopeful to his Recovery, in which ſeaſon little was ſaid to him, or by him; being deſirous to let his ſpirits reſt from exerciſe in order thereunto, if ſo were the Will of the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But his Pains returning, and a Friend asking how he did? He anſwered,</hi> It had been a night of exerciſe to him, inward and outward. <hi>To which it was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, That exerciſes were appointed by the Lord both for body and ſpirit; but how are you ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under them: To which he anſwered,</hi> I am gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly born up ſtill, and kept in peace under all.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Being asked if he had yet any hint how the Lord might do with him, as to this diſpenſation he was now under, as to life or death? He replied,</hi> He had nothing in that matter he could call divine teaching, but by laying all circumſtances within his view, in the preſent caſe together, he thought he muſt go hence, at which poor fleſh was ready to ſhrink and murmur. <hi>It was anſwered, That muſt and would do ſo, while in its preſent being, it naturally ſeeking ſelf-preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and avoyding and ſhrinking at that which threatens its deſtruction, and it muſt needs be irk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom to it, to be following God in wayes it knows not, whence they come, or whither they lead, but yet notwithſtanding it muſt be brought down; for a corn of Wheat caſt into the ground, is not quickned except it die; and ſo in this caſe precedent to the quickning that is to be brought out, on the proper ſubjects of it: Death in one reſpect or other, muſt be brought on upon all fleſhly glory and excellency, even in its perfection. Whereunto he replied,</hi> Yes, it muſt ſo, for unleſs it die, it remains alone, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be brought out in its glorious ſtate, of the manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of the ſons of God, but by cracking the ſhell of this earthly tabernacle, and ſo coming out to it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A Friend coming to have felt his Pulſe; He ſaid,</hi> I have not askt your obſervations in my caſe, it may be thought poſſibly it might adde ſome impreſſions of hopes or fears, if I ſhould know what it is. <hi>The Friend re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, His Obſervations in ſuch caſes vere not very material to acquaint him with; but ſaith the Friend, What are your own Obſervations in the caſe? He anſwered,</hi> His Hope was on high, yet Fleſh he found hankering in his Muſings at ſome ſeaſons, ſuggeſting there was much deſirable work to do, ſome of one ſort,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:40849:107"/> ſome of another; at this and the other place making him ready to deſire to ſtay, and loth to be gone: but when looking up and conſidering the ſtate of things, then he is made to ſay to his ſoul, <hi>Oh! haſte away to thy Mountain.</hi> And, <hi>Oh! that I had wings as a Dove, then would I flee away and be at reſt;</hi> I would not live alwayes, and am ready to ſay ſometimes as he, <hi>Take me away, for thou knoweſt my dayes that they are vanity.</hi> But Oh! I am much more cumbred on the other hand with crying, <hi>How long, Lord!</hi> And ſometimes am ready to wiſh an end, which way ever it be, by recovery or death.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>It was told him again, All our Poverty, Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Unworthineſs, in the day approaching, ſhall but make matter for a ſong the more, to the praiſe of rich Grace, and Mercy, in the Lord's remembring us in our low eſtate, becauſe his Mercy endureth for ever.</hi>

                  <p>I have been alſo concerned in a Teſtimony with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Churches, as to a work God hath had on the wheel among us in our dayes, very myſterious in many parts of it; there have alſo many tryals been upon it, and to try it, and to make up ſuch a tryal, as all things conſidered, hath not been known in many generations.

                     <hi>Another Friend that had been with him about the beginning of his Sickneſs, coming now to ſee him again; He ſaid to him,</hi> I remember I told you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, I had no cloud on my peace, and joy in the Lord, ſince this Sickneſs; but have ſeen cauſe ſince to change my voice in that matter, the Lord having, ſince that, brought me under tryals and cloudings ſometimes, though bleſſed be God, they have been day, not night-clouds, through which God hath ſhined; and I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſo much deſire for my ſelf or others, that we might alwayes be without clouds, as that our Holineſs might might be promoted, and carried on by them, then all will be well.</p>

                     <hi>A Friend asking how he did?

He ſaid,</hi> Nothing at any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty; <hi>But ſaid,</hi> He heard Friends in the Room whiſpering oft, as if they ſaw or diſcerned ſome great change that were not fit for him to know. But I bleſs the Lord <hi>(ſaid he)</hi> I begin to be more mortified to all this ſtate of things here below, though Fleſh and Blood hath ſometimes its hopes and fears in exerciſe about them, but when God knocks off their Wheels, I ſee and then can ſay, by theſe things men live. <hi>Yea, ſaid a Friend, they live indeed at a rate they could not live, were it not for ſuch dyings daily to all other kinds of living, and thereby bringing out to that way of Life, as to which way of Life, it's ſaid, it cannot be brought out but by dying, it elſe remains alone.

                  <p>
                     <hi>To which it was told him, No marvel that Fleſh and Blood did boggle in ſuch caſes, when 'tis called to go in a way it knows not, and a knife at the throat, ready to kill all the way; 'tis therefore reckoned a great leſſon to be learnt by all Chriſtians,

He ſaid,</hi> Truly he knew not what to think in that matter; and when all thoughts about it were made, it was hardly worth a ſerious conſideration, in regard of their uncertainty, and the little of Chriſtian concernment in ſuch kind of knowledge; for though ſometimes it were very grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to Fleſh and Blood, to be able to ſay, hereby ſhall it be known I am a man of God, by my coming to ſuch a place, or doing ſuch a thing, at ſuch a ſeaſon; yet when <hi>Paul</hi> went bound in Spirit to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> under fulleſt gales that ever he went, he muſt not know what muſt betide him there, <hi>Acts 20.22.</hi> nor whether God would be glorified in him by life or death.</p>

                     <hi>To which his Friend replied, It was made poor, in order to enriching; and ſeemed to be uncloathed, in order to be cloathed upon with his houſe from Heaven.

                  <p>
                     <hi>It was told him, If any man ſin, we have an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt, the Righteous, who is the Propitiation for our ſins:</hi> Yea, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> through Faith in his Blood; he is ſo, and thither doth my ſoul flee.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He was alſo cautioned, to take heed of caſting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way any his Confidence, that hath great recompence of reward, and of making a judgement of things, in an hour of temptation and tribulation, contrary to another judgement made and confirmed by the Lord again and again to him heretofore, minding him, how the Tempter waited ſuch ſeaſons to diſturbe him, and drive him from the ſtrength he had laid up for him in Grace, that is in Chriſt Jeſus, when Grace in us may be but at a low ebb.</hi> Yea, <hi>(replyed he)</hi> I
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:40849:116"/> would leave this Exhortation with you, that when God bruiſes, breaks, treads down a poor ſoul, and it lyes before him as aſhamed and confounded, and not able to open its mouth; Oh! then to look up to the Lord, for then will the Tempter be buſie at ſuch ſeaſons; for we are not ignorant of his deviſes; but if God give another day, and more ſtrength, I hope to ſpeak more convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cingly of theſe things.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The next day being asked, How it was with him? Whether all were clear within?

                     <hi>Sometimes after, one ſaying to him, I hope you can yet ſay God is good, and a ſtrong hold in the day of trouble, and knows them that truſt in him:</hi> Yes, I can ſay ſo, bleſſed be my God; but not alike at all times can I ſay ſo; but I remember the counſel and adviſe yeſterday, to wait on the Lord, and keep his way, and my place, appointed me by God, which I deſire to do all the dayes of my appointed time, till my change come, though fleſh and blood ſuggeſt, this is hard work, and would make haſte out of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In the morning following, being asked, How is it now? He ſaid,</hi> God had been at work cloſely with his Spirit, in the three dayes paſt before this, though this was left him for ſupport, That the foundation of God remains ſure to all his ſealed ones; but <hi>(ſayes he)</hi> I have been ready to ſay, Why ſhould I ſpeak of ſealed
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:40849:116"/> ones, being ſuch a one, as might for mine iniquities be ſealed up to a day of Wrath, and be kept in chains of Darkneſs to the great day. I have been ſo fooliſh, to think my attainments were ſuch, as if I were got to the top, and needed little more: but the Lord hath laid Judgement to the Line, and Righteouſneſs to the Plum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, and hath not only thrown down the high raiſed Structure, but razed the very foundations of all fleſhly glory and excellency; and the Lord hath delivered his glory into Captivity, and his ſtrength into the Enemies hand, yet hath not left me without hope, I truſt, good hope in mercy, that all notwithſtanding ſhall iſſue well in the end.</p>
                  <p>But, Oh! the reproach that I have brought on the Name of God! might that be done away by all I feel and ſuffer inward and outward, I ſhall rejoyce.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In the After-noon, the ſame day, it was ſaid to him, I have obſerved by ſome hints from you, That you have in theſe few dayes paſt, had ſome exerciſes on your Spirit, I would be glad to know whence and what they were, and the way of God with you in them.

<pb n="212" facs="tcp:40849:117"/> my imagination, and made ſore work within; but the Lord made me ſee much of my own fleſhly gloryings, as alſo others in me, and in my fleſh, which God would take down in this day of tryal, when every ones work muſt he tryed of what ſort it is, even by fire; and truly I was made to ſee to my ſhame, much hypocriſie and formality in my converſe with the Lord in one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect or other, and that the Practical part of Religion I had yet arrived to little acquaintance with, to what I had in dayes paſt; but this brought me in the iſſue, to ſee, that I was, what I was, that was good, only by grace, and no room for fleſh to glory, but was brought through grace to experience this Truth, that when I am weak, then am I ſtrong; and that however it be, yet the Lord forgetteth not his poor, nor deſpiſeth not his priſoners; this is a brief account of the Way God led me in, in this matter, and hath ſo iſſued it, that I truſt through grace, I ſhall yet come to lay down my weary head and heart in the peace of Gods speaking, that will keep and carry me to the end.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>His Friend told him here, ſomewhat of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of attempting ſuch great works, under ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantages as theſe ſeaſons and circumſtances he had in theſe dayes paſt been under, for ſuch works as theſe, minding to him, That every ſeaſon was not a fit ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, for judgement eſpecially, to be calling in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, things ſo long and often under more clear light, and leadings, confirmed formerly; and however that be a great Truth, that every day will yet more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate, that we are but yet Children in Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, far ſhort of that manly ſtate of things to which the preſent diſpenſation of God, both publick and perſonal, have a proper and true tendency, towards which more excellent way, 'tis our duty to be preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:40849:117"/> yet ſo to be preſſing towards it, as to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber both how we have heard, and received, and hold faſt the beginning of our confidences, firm unto the end, that ſo the Tempter get not advantage againſt us, as he doth, or may do againſt perſons ignorant of his devices: But he, being ſtill weak, either to ſpeak or hear, more was not ſaid, but that he, his Friend, was glad to ſee the Lord had iſſued the matter ſo well, to the Preventing the Tempters deſign, and giving his poor Servants to ſee, how great that mercy is of all the Saints and their concerns, being in Gods hand; when the ſtrength of our own hands, heads, and hearts fails ſo frequently as they do, yet he remains the ſame for ever, and in ſuch ſeaſons, ſecretly ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours, and ſupports, and at laſt brings out into a wealthy place, to his own praiſe, and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the poor and needy, to truſt in him at all times.</hi>

Little it is conſidered and laid to heart, how much of the intereſt of your preſent peace, and the comfort of your lives is laid up in your wiſe, conſtant, gracious endeavour of this kind, and the Lord's bleſſing thereupon.

<pb n="228" facs="tcp:40849:125"/> themſelves, to learn Chriſt, to know the Lord God of their Fathers, to be inſtructed in the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures from their youth up, to know themſelves mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable without a Saviour, and to be led as by the hand unto him. Oh! how rare are theſe attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and that becauſe endeavours are ſo ſlack in order thereunto; I pray you examine your ſelves, your prayers, your practices, your converſations, where are the bowels of Chriſt towards your own! Do you travel in birth <hi>again</hi> for them till he be form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in them? Should it not be much more your care to ſee them Saints, than to ſee them men and women? Alas! if you Families (who would bear the World in hand, that there is ſome excellent thing among you more than others) be not taught the fear of the Lord, where do you think a Seed ſhould be reared up to ſerve him, that in the ſtead of the Fathers ſhould be the Children accounted with God for a generation? Among worldly men it may not be expected, whoſe Children are ordinarily the off-ſpring of their luſt, the painted Idols of the rich and pinching burdens of the Poor, and their Servants the meer drudges to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the Intereſt of their eaſe, gain and covetouſneſs, few enquiring or caring what becomes of their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal precious ſouls; The manifeſt ruines upon whom (unleſs the Lord work extraordinarily upon them) ſhould provoke us to pitty them and be the more jealous over our own concernments herein, in order hereunto ſuffer this further word of Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

Surely, though the perſonal iniquities be great and manifold that have been found in the skirts of the Lord's People, under their Profeſſion that they are Saints; yet do I believe there lies more combined, united, provoking guilt upon them unpurged, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repented of, vindicated and pleaded for, conſidered as they are <hi>Sioniſts,</hi> and in their publick Relations. Ah! theſe <hi>other man's ſins</hi> are ſuch eating evils to ſuch as are in a ſort related to them, and yet in a ſeeming tolerable and excuſable ſenſe free from them, as for which, I am perſwaded not only the Land mourneth, but even <hi>Sion</hi> languiſheth, and her Children faint in the ſtreets, and yet few conſider where is the malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the diſeaſe, or declare the cauſes of baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

Who ſaid to</hi> Paul, by the Spirit, <hi>that he ſhould not go up to</hi> Jeruſalem. How like the language of our ſpirits (heightned by fervent affection, and attended with providential bringing to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of ſutable Scriptures; and all this on a ſoul en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying clear acceſs to the Lord) is, to the voice of the ſpirit in truth as he fulfils that Promiſe, <hi>He ſhall take of mine and ſhew it unto you, and ſhall ſhew you things to come.</hi> And if it may pleaſe the Father, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he hath graciouſly allayed the ſtormineſs of theſe perplexing waves, that at preſent doubtleſs diſcompoſe for any thing, to lead his holy ones into a more perfect diſcerning of things which in this kind do differ, and in mean time inſtruct to think more ſoberly of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and judge more tenderly of others; I ſhall yet hope this ſharp diſpenſation may bring out meat and ſweetneſs that we thought not of. — As for the poor Martyrs themſelves, when I review what was of late ſaid of their particular perſwaſions, and how (when their departure was hid from them) they enjoyed ſuch un-interrupted joyful communion with the Lord, I cannot but admire the wiſdom and goodneſs of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that took that courſe with them, to <hi>anoint them for their burial</hi> (but alas! they had no burial!) But
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:40849:130"/> much more grace to admiration appears to me in it, that when their perſwaſions and expectations from the Lord in that point, gave way to his determinations, yet that at that very time the Tempter ſhould be bound up, who doubtleſs deſired to have them, that he might have win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowed them as Wheat, and would have made a great market of the leaſt diſcouragement upon them over the whole Antichriſtian World. <hi>Oh! how unſearchable are his wayes, and his works paſt finding out!</hi> The deadly Treacle that you ſpeak of, will doubtleſs ſwiftly become a Cup of trembling to this wretched generation, and entayl the guilt of all down along from <hi>Abel, &amp;c.</hi> A very ſtrange efficacy that it hath to cry and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail at length, though it tarry long firſt. That <hi>Abels</hi> was not anſwered and expiated in the Flood that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the World of the ungodly; nor that of <hi>Zacharias</hi> (if it was his who ſaid, <hi>The Lord look upon it, and require it, 2</hi> Chron. <hi>24.22.</hi>) But they both muſt cry againſt that generation that put to death the Lord of Life, and neither of theſe cryes expire at the ruines of them and their devaſtation to this day, but ſhall be found as freſh in out-cry againſt that great City where alſo our Lord is crucified, <hi>Rev. 18.24.</hi>

<pb n="252" facs="tcp:40849:137"/> place, and puts into a capacity for Believers to make the most rare Extracts, and pick out the choiceſt No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Aſſiſtances of any where in the World; which thoughts are eaſily attended with ſuch temptations, Oh! that I had the wings of a Dove, I would flee far away from this ſtormy wind and tempeſt, I would ſee that goodly Mountain and <hi>Libanon.</hi> But then I am as often checked with this reproof, <hi>He that encreaſeth knowledge, encreaſeth ſorrow;</hi> theſe creaturely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements may render a man the more prudent and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional; it's many to one if they make him more ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, ſpiritual, evangelical. It may be eaſie to get the mind fraughted with noiſe, news, notions; but to get the heart eſtabliſhed with grace, drawn into a more ſubſtantial and experimental communion with Jeſus Chriſt, according to the tenor of the New-Covenant, and in the Grace and Truth thereof; this is not ſo eaſie to be found and maintained, without extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry watch and diligence. Theſe words of Wiſdom, may be more heard in quiet, and to better purpoſe and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement, than in the out-cry of him that ruleth among Fools. Soul-ſearching, Heart-preparing, Sin-mortifying work, may have more advantage from the retirement of a naſty Priſon, then (unleſs abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Grace be miniſtred) from being left to walk in a large place, eſpecially if with a large principle of Liberty to touch withal, but being laid in Goſpel-bonds under the Inſtituted charge of none. In theſe reſpects (my much valued in the Lord!) I have not only had ſome tryals of my own ſoul, while I have been repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting things to my ſelf in ſuch a figure; and alſo ſeen the woful iſſues thereof on ſome others who have fallen under my ſhort-ſighted obſervation; but have withal had many a thought of you, ſince you have been

So, I pray you may not miſs of thoſe full free un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interrupted ſtreams of Strength, Satisfaction, and Conſolation, which have been the promiſed and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced portion of the higheſt Saints that have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared for God.

<pb n="255" facs="tcp:40849:138"/> never want the experiment of thoſe conſtant ſupports and ſweetnings that I know a poor worm hath enjoyed in this condition; yet it's not your bonds I deſire, but your bleſſedneſs exalted over the heads of them; eſpecially I deſire on your behalf, that your ſoul may be furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with that ſatisfactory clearneſs in the Cauſe, and jealouſie of the terms of Deliverance that invite you forth; that in patience you may poſſeſs your ſoul, with conſtancy enjoy the ſweetneſs of it, from its fitneſs for converſe with God, and with courage and reſolution refel thoſe Hen-pickings which I preſume is your por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by ſome prudent Cowards, wherewith your City a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundeth, and your large acquaintance hath made you known unto. I truſt the great things, of the Name, Intereſt, Glory, and Goſpel-truths of Jeſus Chriſt, owned by your act, and ſealed to in their excellency by your bonds, will out-weigh the ſelf-ſaving arguments of air, health, trade, liberty, which are things (and greater things than theſe) that muſt be hated upon this competition. That prudent Propoſal of, <hi>Maſter, ſave thy ſelf;</hi> had more of the Devil in it than (I think) <hi>Peter</hi> was aware, when it was brought in to retard Chriſt's opportunity of glorifying his Father, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his People in a way of ſuffering. You well know the excellent proof of the Faith of thoſe Travellers of old, was, they conquered the opportunity they had of returning to their Comforts and Relations, their Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and Countrey from whence they came. Truly, there is before you, and in your hand an opportunity of glorifying God in a way of ſuffering, and it puts me in mind of a paſſage of a good man, treating of the gale of opportunity, thus expreſſeth himſelf to the caſe in hand; <q>A man may have an opportunity to ſuffer for Chriſt, which if he neglect, he may never have
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:40849:139"/> the like again: To ſuffer for Chriſt is honourable; God will not put this honour upon every one, he puts this honour upon his Veſſels of honour, he gives Grace to a man, and caſts him into a veſſel of Silver or Gold, and then throws them into the fire to melt, &amp; ſuffer for his Name. The Mettal of that Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an muſt be Silver or Gold that can ſuffer for Chriſt: a veſſel of Wood, throw it into the fire, its Hoops will fly off, it will break aſunder and never hold out. The three Children that were caſt into the fiery fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, what glorious mould and metal were they made of? Had they not taken that opportunity to ſuffer for God, they might never meet with ſuch a one again. <hi>(1)</hi> What a ſpreading Fame and Glory of God did their ſufferings ſcatter over all the World, <hi>Dan. 3.28, 29.</hi> God's Glory ſhines out of their ſufferings; enemies acknowledge none like <hi>Iſrael's</hi> God. <hi>(2)</hi> They honour themſelves; <hi>1.</hi> They no ſooner in the fire, but they meet with Jeſus there, <hi>verſ. 24, 25.</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Iſa. 43.2. 2.</hi> It was an honour to them that God ſhould work ſuch a noble miracle for them, as to ſtop the mouth of the fire, that it could not burn them. <hi>(3)</hi> Their Suffering was the Churches ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and advantage; it won great reſpect and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church and Religion <hi>(4)</hi> Did not their Suffering, and God's owning them, ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the weak Faith of their diſtreſſed Brethren, the poor <hi>Jewes?</hi> — Your Sufferings may be the Converſion of others: How willing would you be to Preach a Sermon, if you were ſure it would be the Converſion of ſome ſoul? thy Suffering for Chriſt may be the beſt Sermon that ever thou preachedſt in thy life, and may win more upon ſouls; as we ſay, The beſt Living, is the beſt Preaching; ſo I ſay, To

The Lord help you, that by a patient continuing in well-doing, you may commit your ſoul, body, eſtate, liberty, into the hands of God, as of a faithful Creator, knowing whom you have believed, and that he is able to keep that which you have committed to him againſt that day; only the good thing (that bleſſed Teſtimony to Truth as it is in Jeſus) committed by him unto you, keep through the holy Spirit that dwelleth in you. Sell not for a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed opportunity (to buy and ſell and get gain) your real opportunity to exalt Jeſus Chriſt in ſuffering for his Names ſake; moſt who make haſte this way out of bonds, do uſually reckon, they will be more prudent next, than to ſuffer for a circumſtance; and common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God ſhews himſelf more jealous of his Glory, than to imploy them again in ſo honourable a work. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſs, as one of the Martyrs in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> time, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canted his Profeſſion, becauſe (ſaid he) I cannot burn for Chriſt: but ſhortly after his Houſe was burnt (as I remember) and he muſt burn without Chriſt.

I hope it hath had, and will farther be ſucceeded with this iſſue, to awaken me to a farther obſervation and apprehenſion of that great debt that I owe on Chriſt's behalf to divers ſouls, whoſe faces for a long time I have not ſeen in the fleſh, from which my diſtance, in reſpect of place, doth not diſcharge me in point of duty, and be of directive uſefulneſs to guide my way, and inform how I ought to behave my ſelf among the ſcattered members of the Church of the Living God, which is (where it is as
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:40849:140"/> it ſhould be) the Pillar and Ground of Truth; on which, as on a Pillar, that ſhould go out no more, ſhould ſtand engraven, to be ſeen and read of all men, the publick Edicts of our King, with all his Statutes and Judgments, eſpecially in a time when they are ſpoken againſt, and would be razed out; nay, razed to the very foundation thereof, by the ſons of <hi>Edom,</hi> that border of wickedneſs, the people a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whom God hath indignation for ever. The conſideration whereof doth not only require that they be living ſtones, who are competent for ſuch ends, having living tables in their hearts, for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions of the Spirit of the Living God, and that the beauty of this Ornament be ſet in Majeſty, but doth frequently commend to me that obſervation which your laſt ere this (ſome time ſince) was hint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to me of the need we have, who deſign ſuch ſervices, to wait for power by the Spirit from on high, to be his Witneſſes, and to expect according to his Promiſe, That ſhowers of the latter rain ſhall come down to furniſh a people to bear his glory in the adminiſtrations of his Houſe, anſwering the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of the New Teſtament; although I am no way taken with that dilatory inference, wherein ſome ſeem to ſtick, as if upon the obſervation that Bryars and Thorns are come upon God's Houſes in the joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous City, and are likely to abide there till the Spirit be poured out from on high; therefore it were beſt, and our Intereſt, till the manifeſt taking place of that promiſed diſpenſation, not to put our hands to ſuch Acts and Ordinances, the beautious Majeſty of which muſt needs be acknowledged to be very much wrapt up and concerned in the hoped iſſues of ſuch a Glory ſtepping in.

<pb n="265" facs="tcp:40849:143"/> or repent of my Teſtimony in Word or Deed to any one perſecuted Truth of Chriſt, for which I ſuffer; and though my preſent lot be in a place where the ſalt ſharp Air is manifeſtly ruinous to my health, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing me (more than ever I was in my life) to daily diſtempers, and under a Sentence of Primunire, and in a readineſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> on all occaſions, for threatned Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation, beſides other threatning and ſtraitning circumſtances; yet under all, is Chriſt as precious to my ſoul as ever, and ſo is his Cauſe, Work, and Inſtitutions, and faithful Children, and every way as worthy of my All, as I profeſſed him to be in the greateſt fulneſs or plenty of all things; neither durſt I for my life balk the leaſt Truth of Jeſus, which is to be witneſſed unto, for the obtaining any health, liberty, or other accommodations whatever; nor can I expreſs the conſtant ſatisfaction, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times conſolation that my ſoul is made to enjoy in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing God, eſpecially when in my greateſt ſickneſs, about this time twelve month, and at other ſeaſons, when I have been ready to ſtep into Eternity; Thoughts and Pen cannot ſet forth the Peace paſſing underſtanding, wherewith my ſoul was poſſeſſed, in reſpect of the preſent Truths of Jeſus Chriſt, and his heart love to me therein, which do to this day abide in their excellency, and obligation, engaging my ſoul to love and praiſe the Lord for his unſpeakable gifts of Grace to me herein, who have as fearful, cowardly, unbelieving, ſlothful, ſelf-ſaving, a poor heart, as I think any poor Chriſtian alive is peſtred withal. In the mention therefore of this, or any part of it, I would not be underſtood to intend the propoſing my ſelf to any high Thoughts that ſhould be had of me, as if I were better than others, or had
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:40849:144"/> attained to any praiſe-worthy, or exemplary degree of ſtedfaſtneſt herein; for I have much more to ſay in way of ſelf-judging, humbling, and loathing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord; but my deſign in this liberty of ſpeech, is to engage you to a like freedom, and to give you in part a Character how you may repreſent me to your ſelf in your addreſſes before the Lord; but principally, that hereupon I may take occaſion as from experience, the more confidently and earneſtly to beg you, That you would be much in the ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and trying your heart and wayes, examining to the bottom (if that work have layen neglected, as in too many it doth) how it ſtands between the Lord and you in point of union, and relation toward each other. The diſpenſations that are over us, are come to lay the Ax to the root of every Tree; if the root be found to be rottenneſs, the bloſſoms (of an external Profeſſion) will go up like the duſt. Nothing ſhort of true Intereſt in Jeſus Chriſt, laid in real Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and the renewing of the holy Spirit, will hold out to the end of this tryal to any purpoſe; forms of Godlineſs will expoſe to man's wrath, and where there wants the Power of it, it will expoſe to Gods wrath, whoſe fire is in <hi>Sion,</hi> and his furnace in <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem.</hi> Nor will it ſuffice that Intereſt in it ſelf, in Chriſt, be ſafe, barely conſidered, unleſs alſo In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences from him be obtained, and Communion with him be improved, unto a daily reſignation to him, and walking in the beauties of Holineſs before him. Any ſinful ſhortneſs, neglect, abatements, loſſes, of this kind are very perilous in ſuch a time as this, it's one to a thouſand, that is under decayes of this kind, and proceeds in a path of it without early ſenſe and repentance; but that word is verified,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:40849:144"/> 
                        <hi>Men gather them,</hi> they eaſily ſink down into an earthly, carnal, ſowre, diſcontented, fearful, heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs poſture of ſpirit, and then are unable to make reſiſtance to any temptation, whether to ſin, or ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. They therefore have of all others the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, who by the conſtraints of Faith, and Love, abide cloſe, ſerious, ſpiritual, faithful, conſcientious with, and towards the Lord, not ſlothful in buſineſs, fervent in Spirit, ſerving the Lord, rejoycing in hope, patient in tribulation, continuing inſtant in Prayer.

Unto which iſſues, though godly ſorrow working Repentance never to be repented of, hath a very direct tendency, and humbling our ſelves greatly under the mighty hand of God, is the ſtraiteſt ſtep towards the beſt exaltation in due time: Yet when I read the preſent temper (and its tendency) of my own heart, and alſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve in yours, and others late lines upon this heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breaking occaſion, to what exceſs of ſadneſs, fear, diſcouragement, and even diſpondency, we are apt to yield the Tempter advantage to triumph over us, and hardly recover our ſelves to a jealous thought, that there is any conſiderable danger in the exceſs on that hand, but that it is a kind of vertue to refuſe to be comforted; I ſay, in ſuch obſervations my heart hath bin ſmitten with reproof, and ſomewhat awakned to ſtand upon its watch againſt incurſions on that quarter, leſt Satan ſhould get an advantage on us, who ſhould not be ignorant of his enterprizes. It's true, we have loſt a Prince and great man in <hi>Iſrael</hi> this day, <hi>But who was his Father?</hi> 1 Sam. 10.12. was it not the Father of Spirits, with whom the reſidue of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is, and who can at his pleaſure ſet a man over the Congregation; Know we not where is the Lord God of <hi>Elijah,</hi> is he not in Heaven, and can do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he pleaſeth?

Are not theſe diſcouraging complainings of ours, much of the ſame kind, and go upon the ſame miſtakes, and may righteouſly iſſue in the ſame diſmiſſions to us from further ſervice, as it was with <hi>Elijah</hi> in his fainting fit, after he had acted in ſo full a gale of the Spirit juſt before, that now he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains, They <hi>have killed the Prophets, &amp;c. and I, even I am left alone, and my life is ſought alſo; What am I better than my Fathers?</hi> We know the Anſwer of God to him, which I truſt is true at this day, There is yet a remnant according to the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Grace, and Seed that ſhall ſerve him, and ſhall be accounted with him for a Generation. The Fathers, where are they? and do the Prophets, the Worthies live for ever? Why cry we out of loſs? God hath not <hi>lost</hi> them, God <hi>took</hi> them, they all live to God, they are ever with the Lord. We have not loſt them, unleſs they that ſleep in Chriſt are periſhed; we ſhall go to them ſhortly, though they ſhall not return to us; We ſhall ſit down with <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob;</hi> they have not loſt themſelves, they are found in Chriſt: to die is gain; to be with Chriſt is far better; Death is theirs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are Chriſts. The work of God hath not loſt them, if we take it in its moſt capacious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive acceptation.

And firſt of all, we wiſh you knew that under the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties and viciſitudes of exerciſes wherewith our Heavenly Father hath ſeen good to prove and try us for ſome years together, leading us in ſome paths, and under ſome diſappointments in our Creature-concerns and accommodations, that we thought not of, and had not trod with our feet in dayes paſt; Yet hitherto hath his bountiful Proviſion and tender Care over us exalted
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:40849:156"/> it ſelf in a diſtinguiſhing manner, and many times to our admiration, ſo as hitherto our Bread hath not fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but hath been given to us in due ſeaſon, and our Waters have been ſure; ſo that knowing how little we are yet fitted to bear, as a Father pittieth his Children in their low eſtate, he hath not proved us with hunger or with ſtraights, nor called us up to approve our ſelves his Witneſſes in neceſſities, in diſtreſſes, &amp;c. but our lot hath rather been to partake of the fat, and ſweet, and ſoft, inſomuch as if he put that Queſtion to us, to be reſolved according to that expreſs literal ſenſe of it; When I ſent you forth on the Services and Sufferings that attend your Teſtimony, and you knew not whither you went; Lacked you anything? We must anſwer, Nothing, Lord, but in that reſpect have in hand, or we truſt in ſome degree of ſweet ſatisfaction, we have all, and abound, and are full, by the favour of him who giveth us all things richly to enjoy, and is (we would humbly hope) teaching us in whatſoever ſtate we are, therewith to be content. So that at many of the ſtrange preventions of loving-kindneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> even in things of this ſort, we are often made with admiration to cry out, What is this to us, Lord! Is this after the manner of men, O God! Is this a Priſon! If we ſhould have ſought a Priſon in a Priſon theſe ſix or ſeven years, Have we yet found it! Whatever others in the ſame fellowſhip of bonds with us have found, we must ſay, for our parts, That as we have eſcaped the Sword, and we hope the Polutions of the Adverſary, ſo we have found great Grace in the Wilderneſs for his People, his Choſen.— The which we mention, not only that we may praiſe the Lord together, while ye obſerve that we receive not, nor accept not ſo thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully your Preſent in reſpect of need, through that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable

And could we come forth to you in Truth and Evidence, as wiſe and right improvers of the ſenſible experiments we have actually found, taſted, ſeen, and handled hitherto of this ſort; and that the ſavour of theſe excellent things had not been diminiſhed in theſe ſouls of ours, through too much an in obſervent, careleſs, earthly diſpoſition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us down from our advantages of excellency; we might ſpeak more loudly to you than now we can<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Oh! taſte and ſee that the Lord is good, bleſſed are they that put their truſt in him! The Lions (among whom we dwell) do want and ſuffer hunger; but they that fear the Lord, lack nothing that is good. In the midſt of
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:40849:157"/> their ſufficiency they are in ſtraits, while in the ſtraits (deſigned to wear out the people of the Saints of the moſt high) there is a proviſion made of ſufficiency; be ye therefore ſtrong, and very ſtrong, and very couragious, and God ſhall ſtrengthen your hearts.</p>
                     <p>And now for a thankful acknowledgement, though it may not be interpreted as any requital of your holy liberality, What ſhall we farther ſay? than that we do (as we are able) bring the matter in our requeſts and thanksgivings unto him, who is able to make all Grace abound toward you, All-ſufficiency in all things may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound to every good work, being enriched in every thing to all bountifulneſs, which cauſeth in us thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings unto God.
